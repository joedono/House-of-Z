## Overarching Plot
Viserion is trying to cast a spell to resurrect the giants of old, who formed the world and warred over the land before the time of man. Doing so will visit untold destruction on anything small, including mankind. He needs a number of things in order to perform the ritual.
- A large quantity of magic, from a source related to a giant - Spiritwell Flower grown in the Heartswall District **GOT**
- A living direct connection to the giants - Blood of King Samuel of Loftran **GOT**
- Knowledge and Talent to cast the spell. Needs to resurrect his mate, Anguisa
  - Her skull was the keepsake/charge of Ardin's people **GOT**
  - Her soul was sealed hundreds of years ago, and currently lives in Valmar
- Something from the plane of the undead, the Abyss, to convert the energy stored in the flower
- A real connection to the giants - Any number of numerous bones left by the giants

For Anguisa's soul, Valmar and Liara have been taking turns fighting it inside Valmar's head when they switch out. After they're exposed to anything having to do with Viserion, Anguisa will start to fight harder, making herself more known to their conscious minds. They'll start to feel like they've just been somewhere else when they switch, rather than blinking and suddenly being somewhere new in the real world. They might start to feel exhausted or triumphant when they switch, as if they've just suffered a terrible defeat or had a wonderful victory. They might even start to hear Anguisa's voice from time to time. She'll be furious and determined to escape. She'll also be the main reason for Valmar's condition.
