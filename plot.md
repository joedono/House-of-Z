# Plot

## Chapter 1
The Cult of the Venomers, a cult dedicated to worshiping Zehir, the Great Serpent and the Master of Poisons and Shadows, are attempting to take over the world and make it suitable for their lord to take on material form and walk the plane as its new ruler. To do that, several things must be done.

1. The world must be poisoned. This is done gradually through the use of Zehir sigils burned into the ground and activated with a secret ritual. These sigils have the side effect of spawning Shadow monsters that hate sunlight but are capable of moving through darkness and hiding in shadows, even shadows of living beings.
2. The sun must be blotted out. Once enough power has been corrupted by the poisoning rituals, then their power can be harnessed to bring about a permanent eclipse. This will shroud the world in darkness and prevent the sun from burning away the poison and the Shadows.
3. The materials for a host body for Zehir must be gathered.
4. A grand ritual using all the power drawn by the sigils must be performed that will summon Zehir into his new physical avatar body on this plane. Then his conquest begins in earnest and nothing on this plane will be able to stop him.

The first step is beginning in Loftran. Being the nexus of power that it is, if the cultists can managed to poison the city completely, it will be all they need to move on to the second step in the campaign. If they fail, the taint will remain and they can move out to use other parts of the world as sources of power. They'll need more sigils, but they'll be able to enact the second step of the campaign at some point no matter what.

The main plot of the first chapter will involve the players being asked to stop the rituals being done every night in Loftran, in order to prevent the complete corruption of the city. The sigils are not visible during the day, so they must be located at night. They will be in a variety of places, requiring different methods of gaining access to them. One might be in the vault at the bank, or in the attic of a noble's house who doesn't believe anything bad is happening, or underground in the sewer where the power of the sigil has mutated undergorund dwelling creatures into monsters, etc. The tricky part about this is, the more the world is poisoned, the more it will affect the people living on it, making them complacent and lazy. They'll forget that anything bad is happening and some might even actively try to help move the ritual along. It'll be up to the party to convince some of these people that this is still to be taken seriously.

## Chapter 2
The players should know:
1. The crisis only attacks at night. Daytime and areas well-lit with replenished torches are safe
2. They have allies in the House of Sunlight
3. There were two green flashes on different nights that were followed by spawning Shadow creatures
4. If the party investigated the sigil the night before, they would know that there are cultists involved

The players now have to:
1. Learn what the sources of the green flashes are
2. Perhaps attempt to dismantle the sigils they find
3. Be confronted by the cultists
4. Learn what the ritual's purpose is (Summon Zehir)
5. Learn what they need to do to stop it
6. Learn why the victims are having their organs taken

## Chapter 3
The second night. The players have a handful of options for where to stay, each with their own hazards. When they present the information from their investigations to either the clerics or the wizards, they eventually conclude they need two weapons powerful enough to destroy the power source of the poisoning ritual: a source of great light and a source of great restoration.

## Chapter 4
The party elects to put together the great antidote. There are a number of ingredients needed. The clerics or wizards can get their hands on all but one: Mimic Ivy. It likes to grow in areas with ripening fruits. It takes on the appearance of not-quite-ripe fruit and stays that way, never ripening. This means the primary method for detecting an infestation is a farm or vineyard that has started experiencing reduced harvest. The players have two choices for where to look: the vineyards to the north-east, or the farms to the south.

The vineyard experiencing trouble belongs to Makaria. With a bit of work, the party can gain access to the vineyard and locate the ivy. The farmlands to the south have the problem of being close to one of the older sigils, meaning that the farmers are more affected by it and less likely to want to help the players, especially if they drop that they're trying to stop the sigils work. The farmers exhibit stage 3 or 4 symptoms of sigil poisoning, which includes general animosity towards people not affected by the sigils.

## Chapter 4a
The party goes looking for a large Hatching Stone. The only source of a raw, unprocessed stone of appropriate size is the mines to the north, and the only stones large enough in the mines have all been harvested, except for those in the Deep Floor. The players need to obtain several filtration suits to protect them against the overabundance of aether on the Deep Floor, and fix the lift so they can get down there. The Deep Floor is infested with various aether-corrupted critters, including the only survivor of the last mining team to use the lift.

The party successfully rescued Keth, the foremnan's brother, retrieved all the knick-knacks they were bade to get, along with the Large Hatching Stone. They returned the stone back to the House of Sunlight and went out to retrieve the Mimic Ivy.

## Chapter 4b
The party pays a visit to Aiden's wine shop, learned that the Makaria vineyard has been experiencing supply issues. They obtained a writ of endorsement from Aiden that should get them through the door and set off.

## Chapter 5
Having obtained the Mimic Ivy, the party now has to wait a couple days for the Hatching Stone to be charged and for the Panacea to be brewed. This leaves them with some downtime, but the city is waiting for them. They check back in at the House of Sunlight, and Marsh is there waiting for them.

### Side Quests (time killers)
Marsh leads the party on a mission to rescue his parents, who are now devout members of the Venomers, but don't really know what they've gotten into. The party rescues them and brings them back to the House of Sunlight for restoration.

The party gets a call from Theresa at the Wizards' College. Cathlene has a practical magic exam coming up and is having a lot of trouble studying. The exam is on improvisation and how to deal with non-wizard opponents. Theresa enlists the party to serve as stand-ins for the veteran wizards Cathlene will be dueling with during the actual exam.

On one of the evenings before the Panacea is ready, a fully corrupted Brother Kellen and other acolytes betray the House of Sunlight and steal the fully charged Large Hatching Stone. They also sabotage the beltower (again). Kellen and the other acolytes bring the stone to the Maple Leaves residence, where Sisava is waiting to receive it with an army of snakes, Yuan-Ti, and shadow creatures defending him. The party must retrieve the stone before Sisava disappears with it. They must either kill or restore Kellen. If they kill him, then Sisava will leave a trail for them to follow. If they restore him, then he'll remember where he was taken. The party now knows that the cauldron that serves as the heart of this ritual is in the top floor of Loftran Castle. Marsh knows a secret way in. If the party discusses raiding the castle in front of him, he'll volunteer the information.

## Chapter 6
The party raids the castle, either through the front door, one of the side entrances, or through the sewer/caves beneath the castle that Marsh knows about. There is a party happening. Fully corrupted nobles wander the halls constantly. If the players are caught, the guards will be alerted. The players must make their way upstairs to the attic ritual room where they meet Sisava and his remaining forces. Sisava will mention that his master, Viserion, has already gotten what he needs from the city.

After defeating Sisava, the city is saved. The party will find the queen and her children in a safe room, but no king. There'll be a party to honor the players, and they'll be given the Eloreth mansion, that has a nice secret.

## Hooks for next arc
- Ibal still has a murder to solve
- The king of Loftran is missing
- The door in the Eloreth Mansion is locked with powerful magics

## Overarching Plot
Viserion is trying to cast a spell to resurrect the giants of old, who formed the world and warred over the land before the time of man. Doing so will visit untold destruction on anything small, including mankind. He needs a number of things in order to perform the ritual.
- A large quantity of magic, from a source related to a giant - Spiritwell Flower grown in the Heartswall District (GOT)
- A living direct connection to the giants - Blood of King Samuel of Loftran (GOT)
- Knowledge and Talent to cast the spell. Needs to resurrect his mate, Anguisa
  - Her skull was the keepsake/charge of Ardin's people (GOT)
  - Her soul was sealed hundreds of years ago, and currently lives in Valmar
- A real connection to the giants - Any number of numerous bones left by the giants
- Something from the plane of the undead, the Abyss, to convert the energy stored in the flower
- TODO Add More Stuff

For Anguisa's soul, Valmar and Liara have been taking turns fighting it inside Valmar's head when they switch out. After they're exposed to anything having to do with Viserion, Anguisa will start to fight harder, making herself more known to their conscious minds. They'll start to feel like they've just been somewhere else when they switch, rather than blinking and suddenly being somewhere new in the real world. They might start to feel exhausted or triumphant when they switch, as if they've just suffered a terrible defeat or had a wonderful victory. They might even start to hear Anguisa's voice from time to time. She'll be furious and determined to escape. She'll also be the main reason for Valmar's condition.
