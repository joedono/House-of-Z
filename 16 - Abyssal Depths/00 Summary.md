# Abyssal Depths
Ibal receives a Sending spell from his sister, Allannia, saying.

> Big trouble. Your brother was arrested for murder. Everyone thinks he's become a serial killer. An execution seems certain. Come home quickly.

This will replace the normal adventure hooks for The Styes adventure from Ghosts of Saltmarsh

## Changes
The Styes is replaced with a district in the south-east of the Gilded Circle in the Heavenly Cay.

Jarme Loveage, the mind-controlled perpetrator of the Lantern Ghost murders, is replaced with Ibal's brother, Rhys. His execution happens before the players can get to the Heavenly Cay.

The setting is still depressing due to the murders, but The Gilded Circle isn't nearly as dilapidated as The Styes.

Master Refrum is removed from the story. All introductory information can be gotten from Allania.

In addition to the information that Master Refrum/Allania has about the killings, questioning any of Rhys' former staff will reveal that he has a habit of sneaking out of his workshop at night. They all assume he visits the red light district. If the players visit there, they can locate Rhys' favorite places to hang out and his favorite consorts. They will report seeing Rhys slightly less frequently than usual in the past six months.

Sgothgah's devotion to Tharizdun is a deception. It's actually been receiving whispers from the ghost of Anguisa.

Sgothgah is not attempting to simply raise the kraken as a thrall of Tharizdun. Anguisa has been whispering on how to prepare the kraken's soul by feeding it the energy of despair from the townsfolk. Once fully prepared, the kraken can be sacrificed in order to open a portal to the Abyss. This is where Anguisa will retrieve the demonic energy she will need to fuel her animated homunculus of Draffnir.

If the party kills the juvenile kraken or allow the two aboleths to kill it, it's body, carved with runes, will automatically open a portal to the Abyss. Anguisa will appear suddenly and fly through the portal.

## Anguisa's Progress
By this point in the adventure, Anguisa has acquired:
* The Skull of Draffnir
* The Spiritwell Flower - Loftran Leyline Magic
* The Blood of Giants

All she really needs in order to perform the animation ritual is strong demnoic energy, which she can only acquire in the Abyss.

Acquiring another bone of Draffnir isn't required, but will make the ritual more likely to succeed.
