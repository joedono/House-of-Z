Previously, on The Hunt for the King Giant Beast (KGB)

The party made the decision to follow the trail of destruction in lieu of gathering more information from the queen (if she could even be located). They found where the creature fled into the forest on the second night through the northern border of the Tinders. Fran confidently followed the scent of the beast as it had left behind tufts of fur and patches of dried blood. Ibal asked around the area nad discovered that, on the third night when no werewolf had appeared, a disheveled man had come running into Loftran from the forest. Ibal tracked the man down to a barn on the edge of the river, where a nice fishing family was letting him stay. The man's name was Cirroc and he had been traveling from the Heavenly Cay with his small merchant band. They had plans to sell clockwork trinkets from the Cay, as a way to test if such gadgets would have a market in Loftran proper. Cirroc and his band got off a ship from the Cay and disembarked with a large group of people. The majority of the people turned north towards Durrstaft. The only ones who headed for Loftran were Cirroc and his band, and a wizard from the Cay.

Cirroc described camping by the river on a pleasant night when a nearly naked and bruised man Cirroc didn't recognized stumbled into their camp, lost and confused. Cirroc's manager fed and clothed the man and said they would let the man stay with them and take him into the city in the morning. Cirroc woke that night to the sound of crunching, wet tearing, and dripping liquid. Cirroc poked his head out of his tent and saw a great furry beast calmly devouring one of his coworkers. Cirroc was shocked when he saw all the blood driping out of the creatures mouth. The creature turned toward Cirroc. He screamed and fled into the night. Strangely, the creature did not pursue. Cirroc managed to find his way to Loftran the next morning.

The party followed the trail of broken trees as far as they could before it abruptly ended, presumably where the werewolf had reverted to human form. The party managed to find bare footprints leading east. They followed these to the bloody merchant camp where they found the ruined carts full of clockwork trinkets, as well as a few supplies left by a wizard: a spell componnet pouch and a Dispelling Stone. Fran tracked more human footprints and scents back towards the ocean where Ibal found a campfire and Jasper noticed a shed snakeskin clearly belonging to a snake not native to this region. An off-hand comment by Ibal led the party to an interesting theory that the wizard had managed to Polymorph the beast into a snake and bring him here. The party was just able to make out what appeared to be a cave on an island close to the coast, but decided to camp for the night and investigate in the morning.

In the morning, Darquin cast Water Breathing on the group and they enjoyed a calm stroll across the sea bottom until they reached the island. They cautiously investigated and found an old stone dwelling built into the cave. Inside appeared to be a wizard's laboratory. The party failed to find the Glyph of Warding until it was too late and it's Fireball was triggered, alerting the wizard inside to activate his security system. Three stone golems rose out of the ground inside his laboratory. The disheveled and bruised form of King Samuel could be seen unconscious and strapped to a table with tubes running into his arms.

Time to roll for initiative.

Previously, on The Emerald Glass

Ardin, Jasper, and Ibal receive an assignment from Prescal, the Commander in Chief, to locate King Samuel and cure him if possible. They learned that the beast disappeared just before dawn after the second night on the northern border of the Tinders and wasn't seen on the third night. Fran and Darquin take the stuffed bag of letters from the dead back to the Eloreth Manor for perusal. Mori drank a couple guards (Brutus and Sticks) under the table at the Emerald Glass. Valmar wasn't able to locate the queen or any of the royal family in the castle before escaping.

Back at the manor, Ibal and Jasper sort through the letters. They find a couple positively identifying the giant as Draffnir and some saying that he has black eyes, no breath from his mouth, and no blood in his veins. This, combined with some probing questions, jostles Valmar's memory. He remembers very little about his time among the dead, other than the events immediately after his death and immediately before his resurrection. However, he now remembers seeing the black dragon riding on the shoulder of Draffnir and ordering him to attack the celestials. This only sparks more questions as the party plans their next move.

Previously, on The King Erupts in his Bedroom

The party journeys to the Wizards' College looking for more knowledge on how to cure lycanthropy. They are immediately brought up to High Magus Vilafor's office, as he is well aware of their importance, fame, and power. He is able to provide them with information that Professor Galonodel in The Heavenly Cay has made great strides with his "blood essence extraction" procedure since successfully extracting Anguisa from Valmar/Liara last year. He has published several papers theorizing on how this procedure could be used to extract many different types of curses or possessions, beyond simple poison. He has yet to find a willing participant who will sit still as a werewolf long enough for the procedure to be attempted, but he has full confidence that it will work.

Fran, meanwhile, corners Eldon and Faldren, two halfling brothers who are up to some scheme or another at the college, and delivers the letter from their friend Seebo, the Dragonslayer cleric who met his end in Southspark during the War of Illusions. They were sad to learn of his passing, but accepted it as a hazard in the adventuring business. Fran then struck a deal with the halflings. Eldon owed him for saving him during the Ritual of Zehir, so Fran asked Eldon to let Fran in on their escape plan should Fran need to get out of the city quickly. The halflings agreed, and Fran let them get back to their scheming.

Still on the search for new information, the party split up.

Ibal, Ardin, and Jasper went to the Seat of War and met with Prescal, the commander in chief.

Mori and Valmar went to check out the castle. Mori created a distraction and allowed Valmar to get close to the castle. Using the Hat of Disguise, Valmar was able to get inside of the castle to see the destruction up close. No one is allowed into the castle at night, and although people are allowed to leave the castle at night, no one has.

Darquin and Fran took the letter to Warwick to his shop, forged a quick addendum onto the letter saying that Halfrek is dead, and slipped it under the door. They then went to the House of Sunlight to deliver Sister Thia's letter. She was distraught to learn of the death of her half-sister, Raya. Upon reading the letter, Thia retrieved a bag full of similar letters that had been received by other citizens of Loftran. All followed the same pattern. A paragraph of small-talk and catching up followed by visions of a black-scaled winged creature (some accounts identified it as a black dragon) and a giant rising out of the ground and fighting a squadron of angels. Sister Thia correctly identified the black dragon and the celestial, but didn't dare identify the giant as one of the Giants who Created the World. Fran attempted to provide some insight with his children's book of stories about Draffnir.

Previously, on Dwarves are not Stealthy

Fran ducked out during breakfast just before the party managed to deduce that he was likely to blame for the king's transformation. He eventually attempted to escape out the window to his bedroom, but Ibal and Jasper noticed the sound of the window opening and closing. A minor chase ensued, with the party eventually tracking Fran down, panicked and watching the front of the manor for the guards he KNEW were coming for him.

The party unsuccessfully attempted to calm Fran down just as a small group of guards started approaching the manor. The party somehow managed to avoid suspicious through the use of minor illusion magic, persuasive arguments, and the fact that the guards were only performing a wellness check on the neighborhood.

With the crisis averted, the party turned to research. Difficult as it was, the party turned up two tidbits of information. They found an account of one werewolf who wrote that the transformation came with the sensation that his "blood was on fire." Pepper provided what little she could in the form of a note that read "Galanodel". Ibal remembered a Professor Adran Galanodel, who was a professor of biology in the Heavenly Cay and was the one who successfully extracted the spirit of Anguisa from Liara/Valmar once upon a time.

Seeking a more definitive answer in their quest for a cure for lycanthropy, the party decides to visit the library in the Wizard's College.

Previously, on A Hole is a Hole

Mori has a vision during his time as a corpse. He sees a black portal open over the Seacracker Isles. A large humanoid shape appears out of it and swats at a squadron of angels that appear to be doing battle with it. Before it can smash Mori, he wakes up... to the sight of his friends all looking 50 years older!! Illusion magic makes for such amazing pranks. The party spends some time dealing with the clerics at the top of Mount Stratha and run into Alistor and Sophil, the pair of adult silver dragons (now in halfling disguises) they rescued from the Durrstaft Prison.

The dragon pair fly the party down to the cave of the Spine, where after some mishaps, the group reunites the necrotic crystal with the radiant crystal. The Spine is most grateful. He bestows his blessing on everyone before disappearing, "I'm whooooooooooole!!"

Alistor and Sophil give the party another ride down the mountain and part ways. They're headed back up the mountain. The party hikes down to Hazleton, where they are given a hero's welcome and free room and board for the night. Mori reunites with Lily Trueheart, the young human bard who has been making her name around the country singing "The Ballad of the Rat-Catchers", an epic ballad about the exploits of the party. She is excited to hear about their latest adventures and immediately starts to work on new verses for her song. The party have a rambunctious night with various degrees of... success.

The next morning, the party has a send-off with the Brisleys. Victor's Hallow spell was successful in protecting the town, but Sorrin unfortunately gave his life to buy Victor enough time to finish it the first night. Nell also didn't escape unscathed. She hasn't spoken a word in several days. Victor and Naomi think it might be over-exposure to the undead and plan to bring her back to the Deathbringers HQ to seek advice. Nell has a powerful gift, but using it too much seems to harm her psyche.

The party sets off for Loftran. Upon arriving at Eloreth Manor, they behold a scene of extreme destruction. Half of Loftran Castle and 3-4 of the surrounding city blocks are ruined. The destruction stops 1-2 blocks away from the Manor. The Hansens greet the party warmly when they arrive and prepare a nice meal of ham, potatoes, vegetables, and lemon-ade (a new drink that Kara's friend brought back from Durrstaft).

Hubert and Kara tell the party that a great hairy beast, taller than a house, suddenly appeared one night about two weeks ago. It wrecked a good portion of the castle and several blocks worth of houses until the soldiers from the Seat of War brought it down. The soldiers assured everyone the next morning that everything was under control, but instituted a curfew anyway. The next night, Hubert and Kara couldn't sleep, and it happened again. The great beast burst out of the castle, wrecking it even further. This time, the beast crashed its way through the Tinders district, being followed by shouting soldiers with torches, spears, and crossbows. The rumbling continued for several hours before going silent. Blessedly, nothing happened the next night or any night since then.

The party deduces that Fran must have passed his werewolf curse onto King Samuel when he bit him in order to free him from the Polymorph spell that Viserion had cast on him to turn him into a cat. And due to the Giants' Blood that was said to be in the royal family line, King Samuel transformed into a giant werewolf instead of a "regular" one. The timing of the transformations matches when Fran transformed and the full moon was out. However, the full moon is supposed to last for three nights, causing werewolf transformations on all three. The great beast only appeared for two nights....

Previously, on Weekend at Mori's

Ibal decided to investigate a little deeper into Vezdrikex's lair and found a SUPER deep hole that had wind and eerie groaning coming out of it. Rightly deciding NOT to investigate the big scary hole, Ibal left, but not before hearing the sound of flapping wings coming from the hole. He advised the party make haste and leave. Valmar put the necrotic crystal into the portable hole and Fran strapped the corpse of Mori to his back.

The party left quickly, just missing being caught by the Ghost of Anguisa, which had come to see if Vezdrikex had "her crystal". The party fled into the swampy night and ran until they were exhausted. Barely satisfied that they were beyond detection, the party set up camp and rested for the last few hours of night and into the afternoon. An hour or two into their rest, Ibal spotted a shadow moving across the stars and heading north. As morning came, Fran spotted a pair of silver dragons circling overhead. Feeling much better at the potential sight of some allies potentially patrolling the area, the party gained a restful sleep.

The party hiked their way over the next few days back to the Grippli Village. As they hiked, they saw many corpses of animals along the way. Looks like nearly all of the animals within a couple miles of Vezdrikex's lair had succumbed to the undeath curse the necrotic crystal was eminating. Now that its energy was no longer fueling them, they dropped into true death. It made for a very tense hike.

As the party neared the Grippli village, they blessedly began to hear and see signs of life. They ran into a Grippli hunting party and were quickly escorted to the Marsh Father. He quickly organized a modest celebration and officially made the party "friends of the Grippli." He offered to perform funeral rites for Mori, but the party had other plans for him.

The next morning, the party flew up Mount Stratha to the peak and saw the temples to Bahamut and Pelor in all their splendor for the first time. A group of Pelor clerics came to investigate the party and wound up being volunteered to read from the Scroll of Raise Dead to revive Mori. While the ritual was taking place, the rest of the party located Liara and filled her in on what had happened. She was delighted to see them and was looking considerably healthier than when the party last saw her. Hairam the Solar (angel) was no where to be seen.

With the ritual complete, Mori revives and is greeted by a very unsettling sight...

Previously, on Big Daddy V

The party continues the fight against Vezdrikex. They divide their attention between keeping the zombies from getting overwhelming, destroying all of Big V's stuff, dodging eye rays, and dislodging the purple crystal. That last one turned out to be an excellent choice, as the pulsing energy from the crystal was healing Vezdrikex and taxing the amulets protecting the party from its undeath energy.

The Rat Catchers prevailed, and Vezdrikex sank into the blood pool, but Mori paid the price. With an impact from Vezdrikex's Death Ray, Mori was brought down, all the way past death saving throws, and into true death.

Fortunately, Jasper and Darquin discovered Vezdrikex's treasure horde, and found a boatload of money, several potions of healing, a portable hole, and two spell scrolls. One of Dominate Person and the other of Raise Dead. No one in the party is able to cast the spell, but it helps to have a master cleric on standby. Having the spell scroll means that Liara won't have to tax her energy stores or provide material components for the spell. So long as Mori is brought to her within 10 days, he can be brought back without much trouble.

The party bands together to lick their wounds and bring the necrotic crystal back to the Spine, when the sound of leathery wings seems to come from nowhere...

Previously, on I Can't Disappoint Big V

The party started fighting Vezdrikex

## 2023-02-02
Previously, on Soup's Up

The party (again) makes their way deeper into the cavern. They first encounter a bone pit being attended to by some more zombie grippli. As these are workers rather than soldiers, the party quickly puts them out of their misery. Fran locates the mother of all bones before having a small run-in with some nasty fungus.

The natural stone of the cave gives way to more obviously constructed stone as the party discovers some sort of medical experiment room. Three dissected zombie grippli occupy tables in the room along with a cauldron of glowing red liquid. The liquid contains chunks of the dead grippli, including a couple of whole organs. The party swiftly moves on and discovers a flowing river of the red liquid.

They encounter a trio of sleeping zombie trolls taking baths in the red river. Their bodies appear to be consuming some portion of the river as it flows past them. The party manages to dam up a portion of the river, hopefully depriving the trolls of some of whatever they're getting from the liquid, before managing to sneak past them and into what appears to be the main ritual chamber.

The red river branches culminate in a pool that is sparking with purple energy. 4 mirrors stand in the corners of the massive chamber and an altar with several red crystals occupies the northern platform.

As the party enters the room, a voice booms out asking if Priscilla has brought the latest tributes. A massive skull with one glowing red eye floats out of the center pool and sees the party. The red liquid starts frothing in small patches.

Previously, on Everyone Gets Eaten

The party makes their way deeper into the cavern and encounters a bedroom that might once have been opulant, but is now drabby and decaying.  Inside is Priscilla and two more giant undead crocodiles, who the party take down. Priscilla attempts to summon one last squadron of undead creatures, only for her strength to fail her. She was only able to summon a handful of undead Grippli.

The party loots through the bedroom. Fran discovers an Necklace of Adaptation in the frigid bathing pool, Ibal discovers a box containing letters that Priscilla wrote when she was alive, Ardin discovers that the crystal amulet that Priscilla wore was indeed cut from the same type of crystal as the one embedded in the Spine, and Darquin finds a locked box continaing a letter and 500gp.

The letter appears to be Priscilla's final words to her mother, expressing regret for choosing to be a soldier and fear at whatever she was facing at her death. In her mind, she can only see the eye. The eye of Vezdrikex. The party is unable to learn anything by studying the name.

## 2023-01-05
Previously, on The Middle Finger Circle

The party resumes tracking Patricia and her entourage, aided by directions given by Noogle. They briefly have trouble when a fog cloud rolls in. Mori has a VERY close encounter with a small spider. But the group manages to snake their way quietly through the swamp.

The trail ends at a cave. The exterior of the cave appears to have had some recent construction to make it resemble the entrance of a temple, but the construction is rushed and isn't well attached to the rock of the cave at all. There is a small stone ediface above the entrance of a skull with a single eye socket. The party enters the cave.

The first thing the party finds inside the cave is a giant spider nest. Jasper and Mori hatch a "plan" involving Speak with Animals and attempting to win the spiders' favor and gain them as friends. It is a close call, but with the promise of more meat, the party acquires four giant spiders in a tentative alliance. The party explores a little further and discovers a small patrol of zombie grippli. It is a simple matter for Fran to draw the grippli in and for Mori to sic the spiders on them. The spiders are mildly disappointed that the promise of "more meat" amounted to the same meat they were already eating. Mori promised them even better meat, but would have to deliver quickly.

And deliver he did. The next room the party explored resembled a grotto. Ibal decided to toss a rock into the water, and disturbed the rest of a froghemoth, which rose out of the pool with hostile intent. The froghemoth managed to swallow Ibal and Darquin before ultimately being brought down by the four spiders. Unfortunately, this was likely as far as the spiders would be willing to go with the party, as this meat is more delicious and there's more of it than the spiders have ever eaten, and Speak with Animals only has another minute before it wears off.

## 2022-12-15
Previously, on Death becomes Grippli

The party gave chase after Patricia. While they did extremely well with their tracking, Ibal's analysis of Patricia's pace indicated that she wasn't nearly as inhibited by the difficult terrain as they were. But they pressed on nonetheless.

After encountering and dodging a few more of the swamp's hazards, the party encountered a patrolling squad of grippli zombies. One of the grippli caught the party's eye. He showed signs that his mind might not be entirely zombified after all. Fran, Ibal, and Ardin coached Mori into calling out in the grippli language, and the zombie squadron attacked. However, the one lucid grippli showed definite signs of joining the battle solely to keep up appearances. The party dispatched the zombie grippli, and the reinforcements that came out of the water to aid them. And then they met Noogle.

Noogle had somehow wound up being collected, along with Patricia's other tributes, despite still having control over his mind. He smartly decided that his best chance for survival was to pretend like he was a zombie and follow along with his bretheren. It worked for nearly 3 days. Then Noogle's patrol found the party and he saw his way out. Noogle gave the party vague directions to Patricia's lair and warned the party that Patricia wasn't the real threat, her boss was. Noogle wasn't able to provide much information about her boss, only that there were a lot of glowing things in its lair.

Noogle sprang back towards the village, and the party pressed on. They successfully navigated another 2 miles along the path Noogle had told them about, and then made camp. The Tiny Hut and the Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow were definitely needed. For as soon as the sun set, the swamp came... alive? Zombie swamp creatures roamed the land, looking for living meat. None of them paid any attention to the dome the party was safe in. Right on time, Mount Stratha exploded in its nightly ritual, reaching farther down the mountain, but not nearly enough to reach the party. Those who took watch felt as if they themselves were being watched, despite the zombies paying no attention to their little campsite. The party's rest was spooky, but sufficient.

However, upon waking the next morning, Darquin was wracked with pain as his flesh partially dissolved. Despite several high Perception checks, no one could locate the source of the effect. Darquin hadn't fallen asleep on a gelatenous cube, there was no sign of malicious creatures nearby, and his pack hadn't exploded or anything. The party has clearly wandered close enough to something that the very environment has become far more hazardous.

## 2022-12-08
Previously, on The Mound is Now Charmed

The party proceeds to deal with Patricia's entourage of undead crocodiles and shambling mounds. The amount of grappling going on is staggering. Fran goes down while inside a crocodile's mouth, but is rescued in the nick of time by several lightning and fire spells. Mori is engulfed, then escapes, then engulfed again by one of the shambling mounds before escaping and finally putting the mound to rest. Jasper is similarly engulfed, but thinks quickly and decides that a rabbit would be much easier to deal with than a giant mass of plant matter and successfully Polymorphs the mound into just that.

All the while, Patricia has been doing *something* to the grippli in the pen with her purple amulet.

After the fight, the party licks their wounds and spends a few minutes distributing Cure Wounds among each other. They storm the tribute pen to find it empty of both Patricia and the grippli, but their tracks lead out the north side of the pen. She can't be too far ahead of them.

Just before setting out, Mori receives a note through his rogue bag of sending that reads, "Is someone alive in there?" Mori writes back a simple, "Yes. Who's this?" before joining the chase after Patricia.

## 2022-12-01
Previously, on This is Just a Tribute

The party spoke with the Marsh Father, who was only able to say that "bad magic" was responsible for the plague of undeath the Grippli were experiencing. He didn't know where it came from. The party asked about the necrotic crystal, and the Marsh Father mentioned that a woman named Patricia wore one. She came every day to collect "tribute" in the form of Grippli who had fallen enough under the plague of undeath to become feral zombies. While the Marsh Father was sad to see his people ravaged so, he was somewhat grateful to have someone to take the zombies off his hands.

The Marsh Father had Bop and Snorkel, the two Grippli road guards, take the party to the tribute pen. The pen was a fenced in clearing that currently held 4 zombie Grippli, awaiting being given to Patricia as tribute. The party hatched a plan to hide out and gather information when Patricia came to town.

Patricia did come and conversed with the Marsh Father. She was wearing an amulet of purple crystal that was far smaller than the radiant crystal that the party saw at the Spine. She left for the pens before she was almost ambushed by the party. Unfortunately, a couple members of the party were not quite stealthy enough to avoid the senses of the giant undead crocodiles that Patricia kept as her guards. Patricia summoned a couple Shambling Mounds and set her crocodiles on the party, then stepped into the tribute pen.

## 2022-11-17
Previously, on Tangoing with a Necrotic Death God.

The party reconvened at the Temple of Torm. They asked Hairam about the Handy Haversack, but he claimed he had handed it off to members of a specific department decicated to capture and disposal of dragon young and dragon eggs. He might be able to get the Haversack back, but it would require a VERY long journey back to his headquarters. The party elected to rely on Darquin's eventual ability to mimic certain magical items to create for them a Bag of Holding to contain the necrotic crystal if/when they found it.

The party set up for a night's rest at the ruined temple. Hairam flew off to parts unknown while Ardin's Tiny Hut spell kept the group safe. It did not, however, protect the group from the fear that would result from them being situated so close to the ghost tsunami when it went off close to midnight. Nell woke up screaming and was only able to go back to sleep when Liara Commanded her to. The party made it through the rest of the night and were awoken by Hairam returning in explosive fashion to clean up the remaining hostile spirits.

The party discussed their next move as Hairam flew Naomi and Nell back to Hazelton to reunite with Victor. Hairam had discovered something resembling a path going down the eastern side of the mountain. The party would have to make their way through near-impassible mountain terrain before reaching it, but it would most definitely be faster than going down the western side and going around the mountain. Before the party left, Liara gifted them each an Amulet of Torm, which should offer them some protection against hazards.

The party's plan for getting down the mountain quickly involved giving Mori the Cloak of Arachnida and having him use the spider-climbing abilities to run down the mountain without being hindered by the terrain. Jasper would summon a flock of Giant Owls before turning into a Giant Eagle himself, which would let him and his flock fly the rest of the party down the mountain at speed. The party got to the bottom of the mountain within the day and set out into the swamp.

The party encoutnered several hazards within the swamp, but managed to avoid them with some very good Survival checks. Fran put a few clues together and deduced that there might be some Grippli living in the swamp. He broadcasted the party's presence by shouting in Grippli "we mean you no harm". As the party went on, they were able to catch snippets of ribbits and croaks that may have been replies. During their night's rest in the forest, Ibal witnessed a crocodile in the swamp, apparently acting normally, except for the chunk of flesh missing from its torso. During his watch, Jasper saw a pair of large eyes looking out from the bushes, observing the Tiny Hut.

Near the end of the next day, the party started seeing signs of a village in the swamp. As they approached, their amulets of Torm started glowing. They had apparently entered a zone or territory where some evil or necrotic force was working. They were then ambushed by a pair of Grippli spearmen, who demanded to know who they were and why they were headed towards the village. The two Grippli lookouts were also missing chunks of flesh. The party managed to convince the two lookouts that they meant to help, and they were escorted to the village.

The village was the picture of despair. The village itself seemed nice enough, for frog-people, but the demeanor of the people was extremely low. Everyone was showing signs of decay and missing chunks of flesh, even the children. The party attracted a lot of attention as they were brought to the largest building in the village. There, a male Grippli more adorned than the rest, sat on a chair. He greeted the party, but remained sitting, probably because both of his legs ended in bone at the knee.

## 2022-11-10
Previously, on Spiders are Scary, Unless it's You.

Nell and Naomi agree to accompany the party to try to find the Spine. Nell seems at least slightly attuned to the goings-on in the area. With a little help from Valmar, she awakens a little more of her awareness and is able to follow the ley-lines from the temples to some spot deep within the mountain. She also spots a line leading out to the north side of the mountain and thinks it might be an outlet or passage of some kind.

Between the rope and a few magically conjured spiders, the party manages to descend the cliff face and reach the opening. They venture inside, with Nell in the lead, confident that they're going the right way. The party is harassed every so often with randomly cast radient spells. These are doing some heavy damage to the party, but they manage to get into the Spine Chamber.

They are greeted by a half-person. An entirely white man dressed like a circus ringmaster, but who is missing the entire right half of their body. They introduce themselves as the Spine of Draffnir, and apologize (again) for the damage wrought by the spells. The Spine explains that the white crystal embedded in one of its vertebrate emits radient magical energy. There is an empty slot on another vertebrate where there used to be a crystal that emits necrotic energy. There are almost no creatures in existence that can resist both types of magic, which is the crux of the Spine's defenses. But somone took the Spine's other half and took it eastward, likely into the swamp.

One last spell goes off and knocks Nell out as the party beats a hasty retreat. The Spine warned them that the crystals are not meant to be handled by mortals and might be dangerous. The party decides to ask Hairam whether he still has their Handy Haversack when they get back to the temples. Nell and Naomi decide that they've had enough adventuring for one day and decide to stay with Liara while the party decides what to do next.

## 2022-10-27
Previously, on Two Bodies? Again?

The party started their trek up Mount Stratha, hoping to find and stop whatever is causing the ghosts to pour into the regions below. As they climb, they hear a constant stream of whispers from all directions and spot the occasional ghostly figure making their way up the mountain.

They encounter an interesting set of ghostly characters on their journey. First are a pair of children with a mind for pranks. They pick Darquin as their target and attempt to steal his piton. Next is a pair of cloud giant ghosts, sitting and philosophizing about the nature of day, the sun, and life. They are joined by a third giant. The party sneaks their way past. Next is a veritable river of ghosts, forming an impassible crowd in a line going straight up the mountain. The party decides to make camp.

Ibal takes the first watch and can see Loftran from his vantage point. He notes that there are too many lights on for this time of night. Seems something has the city on alert. As Jasper wakes from his trance to take over watch, the source of yellow-green light from the top of the mountain pulses and explodes. A tsunami of ghosts flows down the mountain and washes over the Tiny Hut spell, waking everyone up. The wave flows down the mountain and extends a quarter mile from the base before dissipating. A few hostile ghosts roam around the immediate area before being swept into the still-moving river of "normal" ghosts making their way up the mountain.

Jasper receives a Bag of Beans from his Bag of Sending from Tabitha. He plants one and a giant pyramid immediately sprouts out of the side of the mountain. Eh... a problem for another day. The party continues their trek up the mountain and encounters the ghost of a weeping man named Simon. He has lost his wife. He laments over a necklace that he's wearing. It's one of a pair that he and his wife bought for their wedding day. Simon follows the party up the mountain before encountering three identical ghostly women who look like Simon's wife, Sandy. Through some intrepid investigation, the party is able to point out which is the real Sandy, and the other two fade to vapor.

The party makes camp once more, and once more, a tsunami of ghosts washes over the Tiny Hut and down the mountain. Ibal looks East from his vantage point, over a vast swampland, and sees fires. Torches or bonfires. There's no record of a civilization in these lands, but there is clearly controlled fire. Another mystery for another day. The party reaches the peak of Mount Stratha the following day.

They see a large courtyard, with three stone paths, clearly leading to the temples of Torm, Pelor, and Bahamut that are built here. The temple of Torm is easy enough to see, even in its ruined state. Viserion certainly did a number on it and it hasn't been rebuilt yet. The other two temples are completely covered in masses of spirits, with more joining every hour. They look like building-sized masses of greenish soap suds, with bursts of yellow light occasionally pulsing from within. As the party approaches the temple of Torm, a familiar face runs out to greet them. It's Valmar, alive and well. He was killed by Garlan, the revenant, but was resurrected by Liara. She spent nearly all her energy on the True Resurrection spell, but comes out to greet her old friends, even weak as she is. There is one more guest at the temple. Hairam, the Deva. The angelic being the party gave their black dragon egg to after he crashed into their path on their way to Southspark. Hairam has been protecting the Torm temple from the small number of ghosts who are attracted to it. The greater abundance of radient energy channeled through the temples of Pelor and Bahamut appears to be attracting FAR more spirits of the dead. Where the radient energy is coming from, Hairam doesn't know, but the Spine of Draffnir seems a likely candidate. Every night, the ghosts reach a sort of critical mass and explode down the mountain. It's been happening for 7 days, but the wave wasn't big enough to reach the foot of the mountain until 3 nights ago.

They haven't much time. Hairam will stay in the temple with Liara to protect the area from ghosts. Valmar will accompany the rest of the party to try to find the Spine and investigate the source of the radient energy.

Previously, on It will be Because I'm Already Dead

The fight with the ghosts continues. The Hero of Hazelton, Stephan Shortbox, continues to pilot the C.H.U.M. with enough finesse to be a considerable threat to the ghosts. The two giants are taken down and the rest of the ghosts are mopped up. Over the course of the battle, Sorrin died twice, Victor Brisley dispelled the posessions on both Mori and Jasper, and Nell exploded in some sort of divine light and dispelled the two ghosts that were threatening her and her mother before falling unconscious.

After the battle, everyone maintained a watchful eye on their surroundings, but no further ghosts materialized and the whispy fog devolved into nothing, with the wisps closer to Mt Stratha being the last to disappear. Portsox and the surviving villagers came out of their homes to take stock of the situation and take care of their dead. A total of 6 villagers perished during the fight. Stephan was talked down out of his adrenaline high, parked the C.H.U.M. back in the Mill, then drowned himself in liquor for an hour. Honestly, he totally deserved it.

The next morning, Victor and Mori performed funeral rites for the fallen villagers, with Victor adding a little extra divine magic to prevent the bodies from being turned into undead while he performed a Hallow spell to ward the entire village. Nell begged her mother to go up the mountain with the party, and Naomi was eventually persuaded, despite the danger that not having Victor around might pose. She spent some time at Riff's and outfitted herself with climbing gear and a little (poorly made) wooden sculpture of.... Bahamut? It looked more like a goat.

With Portsox's blessing and heartfelt thanks from the villagers, the party set out for the mountain, only to be interrupted at the last minute by a VERY hungover Stephan. The Hero of Hazelton wanted to wish them luck, and request that, if Mori ever composed a song about last night's events, that he be included. Mori was happy to do just that.

The party, Nell, and Naomi, set off for Mount Stratha, with the potential promise of reuniting with their old friend Liara.

The battle with the ghosts ensued. With help from Ibal and Ardin, Fran managed to break out of the cage and join the fight just as Sorrin went down. Darquin and Ardin managed to get him somewhat back on his feet and spirit him away from immediate danger. Many of the villagers had their lives drained, but one quick-thinking lumberjack ran into the mill, activated the C.H.U.M and started wrecking some havoc.

Can't wait to see the conclusion of this fight!

## 2022-09-29
Previously, on C.H.U.M. is STILL not fum!!

After a tense night under the full moon, the party awoke and made the rest of the journey to Hazelton. It's a small village, half built to serve the clerics making the pilgrimage up the mountain to one of the three temples stationed up there, and half dedicated to the wood and logging trade fueled by the abundant wood that grows in Kornith Forest. The lumberjacks in the town have always respected the forest, never chopping down more than could grow back in time for the next round of logging. So they maintain a tense, but respectful relationship with the various protectors of the wood, which includes Jasper and Ardin.

As the party arrives, said lumberjacks are currently in an argument with a pair of merchants, who are demanding that the lumberjacks step up their logging to meet demands on the merchants. The lumberjacks argue until the party steps in. Things are about to get tense until Portsox, the manager of The Mill in Hazelton, arrives with his accountants and pacifies the merchants with the promise of drink and renegotiation. Portsox greets the adventurers and welcomes them to Hazelton. He advises them to stop at Riff's House of Hunting and Hiking if they plan on scaling the mountain, and insists that they visit the Wood N Tap tavern for drinks on him. Portsox is always eager to hear stories from adventurers, and is delighted that he's seen so many in one day.

The party heads for Riff's to do some shopping. They are surprised to find that Riff looks exactly like the illusionary owner of the Hammer & Nails carpentry shop in Southspark. Riff eventually reveals that he is indeed from Southspark. Riff is attempting to make a living selling climbing gear, guiding services, and useless religious trinkets. The problem is that the only people who go up the mountain are clerics making the pilgrimage, and they have usually vowed to take as little supplies with them as possible. Riff is delighted to sell the party whatever they need.

The party heads for the Wood N Tap, having a strange encounter with a shadow along the way. Before they can enter, they run into Naomi and Nell Brisley, a professional vampire hunter and her daughter that Ardin, Fran, and Ibal had met in the Black Rose Inn over a year ago. Nell insisted that there was a ghost out here for them to find, but it was gone now. Nell was overjoyed to see Ardin again, and Naomi greeted Ibal and Fran warmly. Ardin and Fran left to see to Fran's nighttime accomodations while the rest of the party joined Naomi and Nell in the tavern for a meal.

Fran was hoisted 40ft into the air in a suspended spherical cage for the night, with Ardin standing guard. The rest of the party enjoyed a meal and met Victor Brisley, Naomi's husband. They regaled each other with tales of adventure. Victor revealed that Nell's ability to sense undeath had grown and she had insisted that something bad was happening up the mountain. The party met Lina and Mina, twin girls and assitant managers of the Wood N Tap, along with their uncle Bradford, the ownder. The party had some food sent out to Ardin and Fran.

When the time came to relieve Ardin of guard duty, Ibal and Jasper went out to see him. While they were out there, a strange wind blew down from the mountain. With the full moon lighting up the village, the group witnessed a gradual formation of spirits in the town square. Once fully formed, the ghosts attacked the group and screams could be heard from inside the houses.

Roll for initiative.

Previously, on You Need to Switch to Decaf!!

The party decided to make for Mount Stratha. They made camp at the halfway mark and went to bed in Ardin's Tiny Hut. During the night, Sorrin sent his raven familiar and Darquin sent his... coffee pot servant to also keep watch. While they were keeping watch, they hear a pack of wolves howling from far away. The night continues and the full moon rises.

Fran stirs, as dreams of running through the wilderness run through his head. He howls, and the howl wakes the rest of the party. They find Fran has transformed into a feral beast and attacks them.

Through good use of Bigby's Hand, and a literal dogpile of servants and summoned beasts, the rest of the party killed Fran, which caused him to revert to his dwarven form. Ardin cast Spare the Dying to stabilize Fran, but not to wake him immediately. Ibal and Jasper finish their trance and take the rest of the night's watch. They converse with Fran after he wakes, as himself. He has maintained control over this inner beast for the past 4 months. Fran believes that something special happened tonight that caused him to lose control. Maybe he lost track of time and the full moon snuck up on him or the toil of the last adventure caught up with him and he was unable to keep control. Regardless, the beast inside is exhausted and Fran is confident that he'll be able to keep it under control. Jasper isn't totally convinced and asks that Fran remain tied up for the next two nights, at least while the moon is out.

The party has a fitful sleep through the night, and wake as the sun rises over the hills.

In the aftermath of the battle with Greep and his Lich Suit, the party licked their wounds and conversed with the skull-faced boy. The boy thanks the party for their help, but is distressed. It seems that his illusions are no longer functioning at all. He can sense 6 living souls along with the party, and he implores them to find and take these living souls out of his territory in the hopes that it will "reset" the Skull's ability to defend itself. The party recalls meeting several people that didn't share the odd behavior of the illusions: Halden the dwarven fruit merchant, Dr. Ivans the dwarven surgeon, Fig the human tavern owner, his cat Sparkles, and Neep the goblin.

The party ties up Greep and carry him out of the Skull's cave, which has gone earily quiet. In fact, the entire journey back to the base camp is completely silent. There aren't even birds or insects.

The party has a little bit of difficulty locating base camp, because it is so much smaller than it was when the party arrived there earlier. Looks like all but a handful of tents were actually illusions. There were only 5 real tents. The party finds Dr Ivans sleeping in the dirt where the infirmary tent used to be, and Halden picking through what's left. Halden goes to greet the party, and they all agree to wake up Dr Ivans and go back to Southspark to try to collect Fig, Sparkles, and Neep.

Southspark now appears entirely abandoned. There are grass shoots coming out of the road and most of the buildings are starting to show wear and tear. Halden and Dr Ivans immediately go inside the Leaky Boulder to attend to Fig while the rest of the party attempts to locate Neep. Jasper heads for the Temple of Innovation, where he met Neep before. The outside of the temple now looks as abandoned as the inside. Jasper is unable to locate Neep. Instead, he encounters the spirits of Halfrek, Raya, Juno, and Seebo. The shades greet each other in the sunlight as if they haven't seen each other in a while. Halfrek congradulates Fran on a fight well fought, saying that he witnessed Fran's duel with his illusionary skeleton. The shades then pass along letters to the party, asking them to deliver the letters to their kin.

* Halfrek asks that his letter be delivered to his father Warwick, of Warwick GNC in Loftran
* Raya asks that her letter be delivered to her half-sister, Sister Thia in Loftran
* Juno asks that her letter be delivered to her brother Albert Glendale, former butler of the Elmwall Estate in Loftran, who has found employment at the Makaria manor
* Seebo asks that his letter be delivered to his best friends, Eldon and Faldren in Loftran

The ghosts then fade away with smiles on their faces.

With a little creative illusionary work by Mirv, the party draws Neep out of hiding. He has a "happy" reunion with his brother, Greep, and the party heads to the Leaky Boulder. They find Dr Ivans and Halden tending to Fig by blending smoothies out of Haldens food and spoon-feeding it to Fig. Dr Ivans wants to get Fig to Bramhold so he can get a proper meal, but wants to wait an hour or two before moving him. The party takes a short rest in the tavern before loading Fig onto Halden's cart and hitting the road.

Soon after the party leaves Southspark proper, the skull-faced boy appears before them again, saying that they are now on the edge of the Skull's territory. As thanks, the Skull grants the party a portion of its power. Each member of the party automatically gets the Magic Initiate feat, which grants them 2 cantrips and 1 first-level spell. One of those cantrips must be Minor Illusion, the other can be anything you want. If you already know Minor Illusion (which I think only Sorrin does), then the first cantrip can be anything you want. The first-level spell must come from the School of Illusion, which means your choices are: Color Spray, Disguise Self, Distort Value, Illusory Script, or Silent Image.

As the party leaves the Skull's territory and begins making camp, the skull-faced boy seems to regain a great deal of his power and transforms into a skull-faced man. He conjures a Beholder and some legendary paladin as a test of his powers before dismissing them. He leaves the party with one final concern. He hasn't heard form his sister in a long time. She resides under Mount Stratha. The party deduces that the Skull is refering to the Spine, which is supposedly located on Mount Stratha. The skull-faces man then says his final farewell, and blinks out of existance.

The party camps for the night. Halden, Fig, Dr Ivans, and Mirv take the western fork in the road and make for Bramhold. Neep and Greep take the eastern fork and make for the forest at the foot of Mount Stratha. The party is left with a choice: do they deliver the letters entrusted to them by the ghosts of the Dragonslayers to their kin in Loftran? Or do they brave Mount Stratha to see what they can find out about the Spine of Draffnir?

Everyone levels up to 10!!!

## 2022-08-25
Previously, on Dry Heaving is Good for Your Stabbing

The party discovered the resting place of the Skull of Draffnir. The skull-faced boy appeared and begged the party to grant it some healing. The Skull itself rolled around to gaze at the party, revealing a nasty looking wound in its forehead that was oozing green ectoplasm and appeared to have been made by a creature with great claws. The party also saw a lone goblin that appeared to be worshipping the Skull.

Upon entering the room, the goblin retreated within the Skull and used a stone dagger to irritate the Skull, causing its defenses to activate and shroud the goblin in an illusion. Now with the full appearance and abilities of a Lich, the goblin engaged the party in battle.

As if the Lich wasn't bad enough, the Skull's defenses continually activated, spawning short-lived but extremely powerful monsters to assist the Lich and attack the party. It was a close call, with tons of damage being thrown around. The Skull kept begging the party for healing. After some healing was dumped into the Skull's wound, the ectoplasm stopped sizzling and the illusions stopped appearing.

In a last ditch effort, the Lich slayed Fran using Power Word Kill, but Eliza's Blessing still lingered on him, restoring him to life. The trauma caused Fran to transform into a werewolf and deal the finishing blow to the Lich, and the goblin within.

With the primary irritant now unconscious and a decent amount of healing provided, the Skull heaved a sigh of relief and thanked the party. But it warned that there is still work to be done.

Previously, on Your Beard Game is WEAK!!

The party ventured into the Skull Cave, chased by the sounds of growling, snarling monsters and claws scraping against rock and dirt. They fought against a pair of young black dragons and a party of devils as they made their way through the cave.

Previously, on Stranger Danger

The party met a survivor of one of the initial battles against the monsters. Mirv the elven wizard was hired as part of the mercenary band and sent out to deal with the goblins who had moved into the foothills. His squadron made quick work of the goblins, but then the stronger monsters showed up. Mirv turned tail and fled into the forest, and has been surviving on his own for 4-6 months.

With Mirv's help, the party finished off the last of the skeletons and looted gold and magic items they could find around the battlefield.

The party started to interrogate Mirv about his experiences, until the skull-faced boy appeared again. The boy revealed to the party that he is actually the Skull of Draffnir. He is located down the hole and he was heavily wounded by "her" some time ago. Ever since then, his natural defenses against discovery have been going out of control, producing ever-stronger illusions that fight each other instead of driving away creatures that might discover the Skull's location. The boy pleads with the party to come and heal his wound, but cautions them that he isn't fully in control of his defensive semi-solid illusions. The road underground is likely to be even more dangerous than the road so far. Sorrin volunteers that, since Mirv's tactic of hiding in a small illusion seems to have helped keep him safe these past few months, maybe a larger-scale illusion, such as Hallucinatory Terrain, might be equally effective.

The party ventures down into the hole, and comes to a cave with Hatching Stones in the walls, giving off semi-natural light. The party grew cautious, considering the experiences Fran, Ardin, and especially Ibal had in their last adventure into a Hatching Stone cave. But they press on, amidst overlapping growls and roars from whatever monsters the Skull's defenses are set to conjure and unleash on the party.

Previously, on You Call THAT a Dragonslayer? This is a real Dragonslayer

The party discovered the site of the major battle between the humans and the monsters. They split up to investigate the various features and found a number of interesting things.

First, they discover the various final resting places of Halfrek and his friends. Halfrek himself died protecting a cave that a group of soldiers had retreated into. Raya died attempting to save a small bundle. Juno died in a Fireball of her own casting. Seebo died at the top of a tree that he grew around a troll or a cyclops or something. Each of them had some of their magical items still on them, which Ardin and Darquin set about identifying.

Second, they discover only two or three actual monster corpses, goblins. The rest are humans or humanoids.

Third, there are illusions everywhere playing various moments of the battle. They start out showing people fighting small monsters, such as gnolls and kobolds. They gradually increase in power to cyclops and trolls, and eventually up to a Beholder and Baphomet himself.

Fourth, the eastern side of the clearing had three large holds that led to tunnels that go deep underground. Presumably towards the heart of the monster nest.

Finally, and most alarmingly, the illusions manifest as skeletons that rise out of the various corpses on the battlefield. Some grow in size, and some manifest out of Halfrek and his friends. The party set about making bone dust out of the skeletons.

Previouly, on Damn Mosquitos!!

The party started their journey into the heart of the monster territory, being extremely cautious of whatever they might find.

The first thing they found... was Halfrek and his party.... again. As before, their roles are all switched around again. Mori (controlled by Joe for a few minutes) was volunteered to go and have a chat with them. They apparently had just finished fighting their own band of monsters and were taking a break. They conversed with Mori, but didn't reveal any additional information. They abruptly stopped, acting as if they heard something coming. Despite some pretty amazing Perception checks by the party, not one of them heard anything. Halfrek and his group took off running, weapons drawn, towards the rest of the party's hiding place. Halfway there, however, they vanished from view. Jasper and Mori spent a bit of time looking for signs of their existance before chalking it up to whatever was going on, and resuming the hike into the hills.

The next thing the party ran in to were a pair of cyclops and their chimera pets. Through some creative use of Hallucinatory Terrain and Conjure Animals, Sorrin and Jasper managed to fool the cyclops into thinking there was an approaching forest fire, and get them to move off and away from the path the party was on.

Next, the party ran into a Werewolf. Mori tried to engage it in conversation, but it just wanted meat. After a devastating first round, and with the threat of more wolf reinforcements on the way, the Werewolf abruptly vanished, like a television being switched off. The party licked their wounds and elected to travel on a bit more before the sun set.

The last thing the party encountered before bedding down for the night was the dreaded... Mosquito!!! It was eventually dispatched in the bloodiest use of Thunderwave possible, and the party breathed a sigh of relief.

Ardin put up his Tiny Hut and Jasper further shrouded it with his Veil of Night and Shadow. The party witnessed other spectacles during the night, including another ogre raiding party, a hundred goblins, and an ancient black dragon. None of the creatures paid any mind to the mysterious dome of force in the middle of the forest. The goblins didn't even change their running animation when they ran into it.

The party managed a fitful sleep. Thanks to Jasper and his goodberries, they avoid starvation for the day and wake the next morning somewhat refreshed.

Previously, on Digital Dice

The party and the soldiers battle the ogres and hags. The monsters battled with the battle cry "For The Skull!!" The party triumphed over the monsters, suffering only minor damage. After the battle, the still-living soldiers celebrated and immediately turned to go back to camp, leaving their dead and seemingly ignoring the party.

The party resolved to journey further east, into the monsters' territory, searching for its center. As they set off, the boy in the skull mask appears to them again, begging for their help, before fizzling out again.

## 2022-06-30
Previously, on The War Camp

The party came downstairs at the Leaky Boulder and found what seemed to be a normal morning tavern scene. But they noticed a lot of familiar faces in unfamiliar clothing. Sky Delvers wearing the uniform of the Crystal Meltdown, the band having totally different faces while the band from yesterday were having breakfast in Sky Delvers garb, and the orcs from the Hammer & Nail blacksmith working as waiters in the tavern. The group left as quickly as they could.

Outside the tavern, the party witnessed Wiesgart welcoming yet another adventuring party to Southspark... It was Halfrek and his band again, but thier roles were all mixed up. Halfrek was the rogue and Raya was the Paladin. Strangeness abounds.

Sorrin (voiced by the DM) pointed out that the list the party had been carrying around mentioned that a Skull might have been located East of Southspark. Between that, and meeting the little boy with the skull mask, Sorrin deduced that the party might be on the trail of one of Draffnir's bones. And so, the party made for base camp.

The camp was about as big as Southspark itself, with merchants and a functioning market place. The party met a dwarven merchant named Halden Bramhold, who very quickly deduced that the party was "real". He revealing information about himself that seemed to indicate he was aware of the weirdness. He's aware that food fed to him by the people doesn't stay in his belly, so he's been eating from his own stores. Their money disappears too. He's very nervous about staying and has about had his fill, but with the arrival of the party, he's going to stick around and see what happens. He directs the party to the infirmary, as the head surgeon might also be "real". The party investigates there and meets Doctor Ivans (who I neglected to introduce to the party), another dwarf. Dr Ivans lamented being in an infirmary in a war where no injured ever seem to come to him. The last person he treated was a man dying of starvation a few months ago. The party mentioned Fig, the starving owner of the Leaky Boulder, and Ivans said that he doesn't think he can find the time to head back to see him. Ivans believes that, as soon as he leaves, a swath of injured people will come to his infirmary for his help.

The party heads to the General's Tent and meets Brutus Maxwell, a male human who is supposedly leading this war effort. Brutus is angrily yelling at his lieutneants about the lack of progress and the seemingly endless supply of monsters coming from the foothills. Ibal glances at the map, and sees that the people have the monsters territory completely surrounded and blockaded, so it's a question of where are the reinforcements coming from. Brutus quickly assigns the party to the 4th Platoon, under Plentus Ardbare, a depressed looking man who does his job begrudgingly. Plentus walks the party over to where his platoon is camped.

The 4th Platoon is made up of about two dozen humans, three elves, two full-blooded orcs, and six goblins. Fran notices that the orcs are the same ones who worked in the blacksmith shop, and Jasper notices that the six goblins all look identical to Neep (and all answer to the same name as well). Plentus claims that the goblins defected because their food was better.

That afternoon, the 4th Platoon heads out on a raiding push into the monster territory. It doesn't take long for the party to find a fight with a tribe of ogres and a few night hags.

## 2022-06-16
Previously, on I Lost My Pitons

The party reconvened outside of the Leaky Cauldron and compared notes. All agreed that something extremely weird is going on in Southspark. They decided on one more stop before finding a place to stay for the night: The guild hall of the Sky Delvers.

As they arrived at the guild hall, they found a rambunctious group of miners watching a brawl between three human brothers and a halfling. Fran decided to leap into the fray and see how much damage he could cause, and Darquin placed some bets on him. The fight only went on for another few minutes before the guildmaster, Barnabus Craggletooth, put a stop to it. Barnabus is a brass dragonborn with a shrill voice who commands enough respect in the guild hall to shut everyone up instantly. He invited the party to sit and eat with him and discussed the war with the monsters, his guild's ability to supply the war effort, and the steady stream of reinforcements from the north.

In the meantime, Ibal and Ardin did a little covert investigating. Ibal noticed two people at the bar who looked identical to two workers they saw at the Crystal Meltdown, and after focusing his hearing, noticed several phrases being repeated verbatim in different conversations. Ardin attempted to view the entire room through his Gem of Seeing, and took some psychic damage after seeing a faint shimmer over just about everyone. Something is definitely wrong with everything.

The party left the guild hall and retired to the Leaky Boulder. In the middle of the night, the town went stone dead silent and a harsh wind blew in from the East. Abruptly, those that were awake felt extremely hungry, as if they hadn't had anything to eat for lunch or dinner the previous day. Darquin noticed that the rope and pitons that he bought from Hammer & Nails were gone from his pack, and he was one gold piece short of what he should be. Ibal and Darquin theorized that something was "reset" at midnight, like a clockwork device winding down before someone winding it back up again.

As the next watch shifts start, each member of the party woke up feeling starved. They were able to share each other's rations and stave off the worst of it (no one takes points in exhaustion... for now). Sorrin heard someone calling for help from down the hall. He investigates by himself and discovers Fig, father of Peachy and the real owner of the Leaky Boulder. Fig is bedridden and near-death from starvation. Sorrin gave Fig some of his rations before Fig fell back to sleep. Sparkles the cat followed Sorrin into the room, and cuddles with Fig before Sorrin roughly brought Fig back to Jasper to translate what the cat was thinking. Sparkles confirmed that Fig smelled "good", like the party did. Sorrin deduced that there is some sort of extremely powerful illusion magic at play here, and that it's likely Fig is real and dying of starvation due to only eating illusionary food for so long, and sets out into the night to look for glyphs or other magical symbols that might be channeling some sort of massive spell across the town.

Sorrin didn't find any glyphs or runes across town, but he was approached by a heavily wounded boy in a tattered cloak wearing a skull mask. The boy was.... fizzling. His image would flicker and almost disappear, like a candle that's just about to go out. He begged Sorrin for help, saying "I can't keep this up for much longer but I don't know how to stop." The boy pointed to the east, and asked for help from Sorrin and his friends, before vanishing entirely. Sorrin returned to the Leaky Boulder to fetch everyone as the sun started to rise.

Previously, on Many Poops

The party is given the grand tour of Southspark, which includes pointing out the various points of interest. Wiesgart and Halfrek have some (strangely identical) laughs at the party's expense. They have not been taken very seriously, considering they introduced themselves as pest control. Wiesgart assumes they're meant to service the town, while Halfrek and his band, having introduced themselves as dragon slayers, are meant for the war effort. After finishing their tour, the party splits up to check out the various points of interest.

Darquin and Fran check out the Hammer & Nails, the carpentry, blacksmith, and merchant shop. Fran manages to sneak his way back into the woodworking and black smith areas, and finds very little out of place. It just looks a little bare. You'd expect there to be more activity, or at least more in-progress projects. Darquin purchases some bits and bobs for climbing, and they leave.

Sorrin, Ardin, and Ibal head for Crystal Meltdown, the metal refinery. It is a dizzying network of conveyor belts, elevators, and other machinery meant for transporting, sorting, and smelting the ore brought back by the miners in the Finger Peaks. It is run by a very... expressive elven woman named Alvarin Mist, who can't go 20 seconds of conversation without Misty Stepping off to correct one of her workers. Sorrin gathers her attention while Ardin and Ibal have a look around. Ardin discovers that only about a third of the papers in the main office of the refinery actually have anything written on them. The rest are blank. Ibal discovers that the conveyor belts and machinery arrangement defy perspective and are impossible to map. They change and rearrange as you pay attention to them. He even took some psychic damage trying to draw them in his journal. Sorrin learns a little more about the war. The people of Southspark are fighting a band of monsters that have made their home in the foothills to the east. At first, it was some roving band of vermin, gnolls or kobolds or something. But then they started reinforcing their numbers with ogres and hags and other bigger beasties. One person even reported that they saw the tarrasque, but everyone dismissed that as a crocodile or something.

Mori goes to the Leaky Boulder, the local tavern, and orders some ale from the 14-year-old "owner", Peachy. Peachy reveals a bit of magical talent herself. She is able to manifest her father's voice in order to shout orders across the tavern. She runs the tavern well, considering how young she is. She says that her father, the real owner, has been bedridden for almost a year now, and he seems to get weaker every day. The town doctor is busy tending to the front lines of the war. Peachy is doing her best to stay cheerful. Mori notices that the band in the tavern has played the same song 3 times in a row. He tries shouting some horrible requests, but gets no reaction. He goes over to try and play some variety into their act. They politely refuse or ignore his attempts, and play the same song again and again. Before leaving in a huff, Mori is accosted by Peachy's cat, Sparkles. Peachy claims that Sparkles doesn't warm up to anyone, but he's been nothing but fierce towards her and has taken an immediate liking to Mori, to the point of following him out of the tavern when he leaves.

Jasper pays a visit to the Temple of Innovation. From the outside, the temple looks normal, but quiet. Jasper tries the door, only to find a rather solid illusion. He pushes his way through it, and discovers that the inside of the temple was long abandoned. Everything valuable was taken and the rest has fallen into disrepair. Jasper investigates, and discovers that, in the basement, a young goblin named Neep has been hiding from the people, subsisting on rats, for "many poops". After feeding Neep some of his rations, Jasper convinced Neep to share a little more of his story. He came here with "friends" from the foothills, but his friends were chased off by the people, leaving Neep behind. Neep has been hiding in the temple, eating rats, for a long time. He's too scared to go outside where the people are. Jasper promised Neep that he and his friends would try to find Neep's friends and reunite them.

The party gathered together again outside the Leaky Boulder to compare notes and decide what to do next.

The party set out from Bramhold. It is a three day horseback ride to Southspark. Over the course of the journey, the party notices a new star in the sky. They keep track of it for the first night and into the next evening. The star rapidly increases in size until it resolves into the form of a meteor. It crashes nearby, killing all but three of the party's horses and removing the land from around the Tiny Hut that most of the party was camping in. The group manages to get down out of the Hut, and Ibal goes to investigate the creature in the center of the crater. It turns out to be some sort of celestial. It is humanoid, but has marble white skin and feathery wings. It is also covered in bloody wounds and smells faintly of dragon breath. Ardin healed the angel a little, who awoke. The angel's name was Hairam. He immediately attempted to fly away and "return to his mission" but he was still too injured. While recovering, the party made some conversation. Hairam was cagey about the details of his mission, but the party was more concerned about their own mission. After some persuading, Hairam revealed that, without his weapon, he was unable to destroy the black dragon egg the party had been carrying. However, he agreed to take the egg back to his superiors, provided that he could also take whatever the party was using to prevent the egg charm from taking hold of anyone. The party decided to give up their Handy Haversack, and Hairam flew away to the north-east with the egg. It was then that the party noticed the glow of a large fire on the horizon to the south. They decided to travel through the night.

The next morning, just before sunrise, the fire winked out. It didn't die down. It abruptly disappeared. With the rising sun, the party was able to see Southspark for the first time. They were only able to make out that the town contained many tall wooden buildings. Then they heard singing from behind them. A small party of other adventurers were making their way south as well on horseback.
Halfrek, the male human paladin of Pelor
Raya, the female elven rogue
Juno, the female human sorceror
Seebo, the male gnome cleric

This new party was singing an off-key traveling song. They seemed friendly and offered to travel with our heroes. During their conversation, Halfrek revealed that they had also come from Loftran. They were being sent as reinforcements for the war that Southspark had been fighting against a tribe of monsters that had settled into the foothills to the east of Southspark, in the direction where the party saw the fire on the horizon. Ibal inwardly questioned this. Halfrek appeared to be telling the truth, but Ibal probably would have heard of any sort of military reinforcements being sent out from Loftran, given his position in the Seat of War.

Mysteries abound as the parties arrive in Southspark. The town is crisscrossed with ropes and pulleys, carrying goods on gondolas are ferried through the air. Ziplines between buildings have people swinging on them nearly every second. The town is awash with activity. The party is greeted by an elven man in a green coat who introduces himself as Wiesgart, and declares himself to be their guide while they're in Southspark, the happiest town south of Bramhold (and the only town south of Bramhold, as Fran pointed out).

Previously, on We Don't Go To Southspark

In the morning, the party attempted to track down Sorrin. He had been perusing the books in the hidden library of the manor, learning about the family that used to live there. Kara walked in with the morning mail, which included a letter from Valmar (!!!). The letter started off as normal correspondence, but mentioned dreaming about a black winged shape, a giant, and angels. The letter then devolved into panicked scribbles that spelled out "SHE'S HERE SHE'S HERE SHE'S HERE SHE'S HERE SHE'S HERE SHE'S HERE" before trailing off. Understandably shaken, the party set out for the House of Sunlight.

The party successfully communed with a celestial being. The background noise sounded like there was a battle going on, but the being was able to spare a minute to answer questions. The answers the party got amounted to this: there is a method of destroying dragon eggs that does not require divinity, but does require some form of ancient magic. The celestial beings refused to help the party directly, as they are "busy", but seemed to indicate that the party should be able to accomplish this themselves. They finally said that they were extremely satisfied with the work that Brother Kellen and Sister Thia had been doing in the temple. As they were deciding what to do next, Thia and Kellen felt a disturbance in the force to the south. They couldn't explain it, only that they had sensed something seriously wrong happening in that direction. So, the party immediately purchased a few horses and made their way south to Bramhold.

Bramhold is a little farming village, close enough to Loftran to take advantage of the naturally fertile ground that makes the city so prosperous, but not so close as to be prohibitively expensive to live on. While there, the party ran into Maaz and Vorsa, two grippli that the party saved from the Yuan-Ti (snake people) invaders some time ago. They recounted that their crab meat trade had resurged since the party left them, and that their excavation under the temple had gone well, until some presence seemed to make the darkness darker. The miners refused to go back in, and the Kalashtar scholar (Kylah's character) said that the presence was telling them "That's far enough. Stay on the surface, where you belong". They haven't tried excavating any more.

The party also ran into Lily Truehart again, who was in the process of embellishing the "Ballad of the Rat-Catchers" even more, hoping to turn it into her career-making song. She's taking inspiration from her favorite childhood storybook, Draffnir's Last Stand. Upon seeing the cover, depicting a giant standing against angels, the party immediately attempted to look through it for clues. All they really found was a collection of stories designed to teach children lessons about life. The only story mentioning an egg was when one broke open on Draffnir's head and he had to take responsibility and apologize to the great bird that laid it.

However, both Lily and the grippli were cautioned by their masters to not travel any further south than Bramhold. Looks like the party has some more traveling to do, as they settle down to spend the night in Bramhold.

Previously, on Jackie Does Research

The party greeted each other at breakfast the morning after the party at the palace. They discussed their previous adventures with the Hansens, had some hijinks with Tabitha's potions, and set out for the Wizard's College to do more research on dragons.

At the college, the party ran into Baern Frostbeard, the dwarf professor who wrote the paper on Liara/Valmar's "dragon problem". After reminiscing for a little, the party heads into the Library. Their research EVENTUALLY leads them into the Forbidden Section, where they find one account of a being known as a Planetar destroying a clutch of red dragon eggs. Seeking more information, the party goes to the House of Sunlight, where they find Helen seeking further treatment for her dragon ailment. Sister Thia is largely unsuccessful, but the women are determined to find a cure. Helen leaves awkwardly.

Sister Thia is able to provide only a little information. She says that there is great animosity between the dragons and the celestials, so it's not surprising that there would be an account like the one the party found. Sorrin offers the idea of casting Contact Other Plane to ask a celestial being directly if the legend is true. Sister Thia cautions against the risk of such a spell, but says that she will aid the party the next morning after she has rested and recovered her magic.

The party sleeps in the manor for the night, and heads to the House of Sunlight the next morning.

Previously, on Don't Drink the Special Punch

The party takes a short rest at Eloreth Manor and gets ready to attend the ball at the Loftran palace. While in various degrees of formal wear, the party attends the ball. Various hijinks ensues, including meeting the rest of the royal family, making the acquaintance of a traveling bard named Lily Truehart, and stopping the remains of the dragon ooze from infecting everyone through the fruit punch brought by a chef from the Maple Leaves.

The party is each rewarded with one King's Boon, which they can use to ask the king for any favor of which he is capable of honoring. He and the queen both remind the party that boons are not transferable, and should they perish or disappear from the story, the boons will be forfeit.

The party returns to the manor for the night to plan their next destination. They still have a black dragon egg to deal with.

## 2022-04-14
Previously, on You Have Some Eggsplaining To Do

The party manages to get the unconscious Helen and the black dragon egg out of the cistern. There is a lot of commotion on the first floor of Maple Leaves as residents heard the sounds of fighting coming from the basement. The head chef is still looking for his lost cauldron when Fran spies a brown cat that has been following the group. Through Jasper's Speak with Animals spell and an overly bloodthirsty bite from Fran, the cat suffers enough damage to "kill" it and undo the Polymorph spell that it had been under. The cat was actually Pads, former pet of Shani Longspotter, acolyte of Torm and actually Viserion in disguise. With the polymorph spell undone, Pads reverts into the form of King Samuel of Loftran, who had been missing since the Yuan-Ti ritual one year ago. Jasper and Fran agree to escort the king back to the castle and do all they can to avoid too much attention before the king is safe.

The head chef comes dangerously close to discovering the group and forcing them to explain why they have a giant egg and an unconscious half-dragon lady in an employees-only area when Mori swoops in and guides him downstairs to his missing cauldron. The chef is understandably upset at the acidic oozes and the giant clockwork kraken that have appeared in the cistern, but believes Mori's story that they're pest control and that the situation could have been a lot worse if they hadn't been there. The chef gets his cauldron back and invites Mori and company back for free stew that evening.

Ibal carries Helen to the House of Sunlight and explains everything that happened to Sister Thia. Thia is able to heal Helen's mind entirely, but isn't able to completely remove the draconic corruption from her body. Helen will be fine once she wakes up in a couple hours.

Ardin, Sorrin, and Mori start bringing the egg across town to Tabitha's. Sorrin and Mori start to succumb to the egg's charm power before Ardin throws a cloak over it. That is enough to snap them out of their charm, but not enough to remove the effect entirely, as a small group of bystanders appear enthralled by the egg and start to follow the group. Thinking quickly, Sorrin and Ardin put the egg into the Handy Haversack, which appears to be enough to block the effect as the bystanders go about their business.

Fran and Jasper succeed in delivering the king back onto the castle grounds through a secret entrance through the castle wall. The thankful king invites them back to the castle that evening to receive their just reward. Fran is now double-booked: a reward from the king? or free stew?

Ardin, Sorrin, Mori, and Ibal reconvene at Tabitha's, help her clean up, and discuss what to do with the egg. Tabitha has harvested enough black dragon egg shavings to supply her experiments long past her own lifespan and wants nothing more to do with it. She suggests that the party seek out groups that have had dealings with black dragons. The group can think of two that have had dealings with the egg's parents specifically: The Deathbringers in the Heavenly Cay and the Clerics of Torm in Durrstaft.

Before they leave, Tabitha inquires what brought Sorrin to the shop. Sorrin shows Tabitha a letter he received from his dead friend. The letter speaks of winged beasts, and a giant rising from the ground to fight a group of angels. Tabitha reacts with horror and runs into her shop. She returns with a letter of her own, also from a long-dead acquaintance and also mentioning winged beasts, a giant coming out of the ground, and fighting angels. Tabitha and Sorrin wonder if something is disturbing the dead on a large scale.

Also, Mori picked up the Chaotic Bag of Sending that is STILL dropping random bits of equipment into Tabitha's shop.

Previously, on CHUM, CHA-CHUM, CHUM, CHUUUUUUUM

The party engages Helen in the cistern. They topple over the cauldron into the water, and deal with Helen and her friends.

In the aftermath, the party receives a note from Tabitha, who has some ideas on what to do with the egg. They gather up Helen and the egg (and leave the inert oozes and C.H.U.M. in the cistern) and make their way upstairs. On the way, Mori and Darquin feel a bit of a pull towards the egg. It seems just a little more precious to them.

## 2022-03-31
Previously, on CHUM is not FUM

Ibal, Fran, and Darquin were enjoying a beautiful spring afternoon in Eloreth Manor when Ardin decided to pay a visit. On the way in, he met an elven gentleman named Jasper Windywood, who had come into possession of some of Valmar's belongings on the side of the road in the forest south of Mt Stratha. As the group was reminiscing about Valmar and "interrogating" Jasper, both Ibal and Jasper received a ping from their respective Bags of Sending. Tabitha had sent them a hastily scrawled note asking for help.

When the party arrived at Tabitha's shop, they found it ransacked and reeking of acid. They met two other rather interesting people, Mori Yulandon and Sorrin Terinlove, who had their own reasons for coming to Tabitha's shop. The group found Tabitha near-death in the back room of her shop.

After some hasty healing magic, Tabitha told her story. Her apprentice, Helen, had apparently fallen victim to the charming magic emitted by dragon eggs when they aren't cared for by their proper parents. Helen likely now thought of herself as the egg's mother and caretaker, and she meant to hatch it. Tabitha tried to stop her, but Helen manifested aspects of a black dragon, incapacitated Tabitha, and fled with the egg and one of Tabitha's packages from Springs, Sprockets, and Servants, an artificery shop in the Heavenly Cay. Fran tracked the lingering smell of acid in the air across town to Warwick GNC, an apothecary shop in the Tinders that mostly sells snakeoils and herbal remedies. The group interrupted an interaction between Warwick and some paying customers and discovered that Helen had indeed come in and purchased several gallons of acid, among other things, and left.

The party again followed Helen's much stronger trail to the Maple Leaves residence hall, where her scent was lost amidst the various perfumes on the residents and the strong smell of dinner cooking in the kitchens. After some time-wasting shenanigans, the party eventually concluded that Helen had stolen a cauldron from the kitchen and brought it down into the cistern under the Maple Leaves where she might have some time alone. The party made their way downstairs and located Helen across the water.

Upon confronting her, Helen unleashed several alchemical oozes into the water, and activated the package she had stolen from Tabitha, a perfected Complete Household User Manager, or C.H.U.M.

Let's roll some initiative.

Previously, on Intermission

A whole mess of things happened.

Cathlene graduated from the Wizard's College and inspired Theryn to set up a school in Loftran.

The party was invited to a much more lavish party at the Makaria Manor, where Ardin, Theryn, and Fran took first, second, and third place in a wrestling contest.

Ibal got employed with the city guard and set about correcting the many problems in their processes, setting himself up to be the most annoying but smartest police consultant in Loftran.

Tabitha made great use of Ibal's willingness for experimentation. He grew a tree with a mouth that repeated "I am a tree" at odd hours of the night, he drank a potion that made him float but kept him upside-down the entire time, and he drank a potion that instantly made everyone within 50 feet of him horribly drunk.

Liara returned to her home temple on Mount Stratha with her sacred book to rebuild her home.

Ardin returned to Konnith Forest and spent his days rebuilding his own home and working on a special set of armor.

Fran ate Carl in the first month, then spent the remaining year attempting to gain control over his lycanthropy.

Darquin learned from Kara Hansen, the party's housekeeper, that the Other Other Other Other Meat... was just pork. But he did perfect a recipe for lemonade before returning to Durrstaft to train in his artificery. He still visits every so often.

Valmar left to pursue information on the Ghost of Anguisa, but met an old "friend" on the road and hasn't been heard from since.

In the last month before the return of summer, Ibal received a worrying note through Tabitha's Bag of Sending. All it says, in A horrible scrawl, is H...E...L...P...

Previously, on Betrayal

The fight with Viserion was going pretty well. The litany of debuffs were making things difficult for the beast. Between the help from the temple constructs and successfully dividing Viserion's attention between the main party and Anguisa's skull, the party managed to wear down the fearsome dragon until he got desperate. With a well-aimed Fireball, Valmar managed to completely destroy Anguisa's skull. Such a loss would not completely prevent the resurrection ritual, but would severely hamper its chances of success. Viserion flew into a rage and made several last ditch efforts to defeat the party.

Theryn's forsight payed off when he bore the brunt of Viserion's rage in a point-blank acid breath attack, that did no damage to Theryn at all, thanks to the filtration suit he was wearing. Seeing his hope for victory dwindling, Viserion brought out the vessel that held Anguisa's soul and shattered it, hoping that the ghost of his love would aid him in the battle. Anguisa blamed Viserion for abandoning her in her hour of need, slashed him across the face, and fled through the ceiling of the temple. Viserion's spirit was shattered, and he was reduced to a sobbing mess. That is, until Theryn rounded the corner. Viserion renewed his fight, only to be brought down by one shot of the Stormbow.

In the aftermath of the fight with Viserion, Drusilla stood in for the final ceremony, granting Liara the title of Master Cleric and restoring her body to her. Now separate from Valmar at last, and having recovered the treasured spellbook of her order, Liara had found her purpose again. She had learned how to protect what was precious to her, and deserved the title of Master.

The party returned to their manor in Loftran (or to their home elsewhere) to enjoy a much needed vacation. We will pick up this adventure one year later, potentially with some new characters.

## 2022-02-21
Previously, on Finally! A Dragon!!

The party staged an ambush in the village square and waited for Viserion. He arrived in the guise of Master Nathan, but was quickly unmasked. He brought the spellbook of Torm that Liara had been looking for as well as the skull of Anguisa, in preparation for the resurrection ritual.

The battle quickly got underway.

## 2022-02-14
Previously, on Wolves and Can Openers

It was a grueling and tense battle with Victoria and her wolf pack. Claws and teeth sank into flesh at every turn. While the party was whittling down the newer werewolves, they were taking heavy losses.

Then a great rumbling shook the forest and a horrid roar could be heard on the wind. Victoria and her remaining wolf pack suddenly abandoned the battle and ran off in the direction of the entrance to the final challenge chamber. Drusilla, now clad in her elven disguise again, came out of her burned hut. She congratulated Liara on her performance in the final trial, but said that there was a new emergency. An intruder had entered the challenge chamber, and Drusilla vowed to help the party defeat it.

She also granted the party a boon, as they all immediately gained the effects of a long rest and leveled up, hopefully becoming powerful enough for the battle ahead.

Also.... Fran has contracted Lycanthropy.

## 2022-02-07
Previously, on Suspicious Silver

The party managed to dispatch Drusilla, the hag who had been living in the hut in Wardenwood Forest. After her death, her hut immediately aged 100 years. The party was able to see a dozen prisoners chained to the wall in the basement of the hut. They've been malnourished and hurt, but didn't appear to be in any danger of dying at the moment.

Darquin, Fran, and Ardin investigated the upper floor and found some manacles, a bag of silver nails, and a Wand of Paralysis. Darquin brought the bag down into the basement and showed the prisoners the nails, causing them to panic and some of them to flee into the forest. Several more horrifying events added to the panic: a howl in the night, a ghostly image, the rising full moon. Eventually, the party was left by themselves, and there was definitely SOMETHING out in the woods. Something had been picking off the villagers as they fled.

Before the party could make any attempt to move away or retreat into the house, they were surrounded by growling and snarling. A large bipedal wolf creature stepped out of the darkness and said "Thank you for the additions you've made to my pack" before lunging at the party.

## 2022-01-31
Previously, on The Other Other Other Other OTHER Meat

The party successfully dispatched the mind-controlling ghosts and passed the third challenge, the challenge of Sacrifice. Fortunately, the only sacrifice that was made was Pumpkin. The party then earned themselves a long rest in the next time chamber.

After recovering from their three grueling challenges, the party discovered the mural for the final challenge, which didn't make much sense to them. Liara knew that there were only supposed to be 4 tenats of Torm, but the second challenge claimed to represent the second and third tenats. There should be none left. And yet, there was a fifth mural above the door to the final challenge. That of the knight, bloody and beaten, protecting a group of small figures from a larger version of the small figure he had been protecting in the previous murals. The word "SELF" was written above the mural, where the previous tenats had been written above the other murals. Selflessness, focus, drive, sacrifice, and.... self? It doesn't seem to make sense.

The door to the final challenge opened. The party expected to find more worked stone and the inside of a temple. What they found instead was a warm forest at night, complete with nocturnal critters and a light breeze rustling the leaves. It even smelled of sap and wet grass. The party ventured into the forest and encountered a small hut with candlelight coming from inside. They were almost immediately attacked by a pack of plant beasts. Just before defeating the last one, a beautiful half-elven woman ran out of the hut with a handful of burning sage, attempting to ward off the beast. She invited the party inside so she could tend to their wounds, but they were suspicious. Ardin used his Gem of Seeing and revealed the woman to be a hag. The party revealed their suspicion when Ibal attempted to hide in the underbrush. The hag revealed her true form and took control of the plants and vines around the party.

Roll for initiative.

## 2022-01-17
Previously, on How do Buttons Work?

It was a grueling fight, but the party managed to proved themselves capable of protecting that which needed protecting. In the second challenge, the party was faced with a rather complicated puzzle. Ibal was shunted off to a platform by himself and the party was tasked with finding the right combination of pressure-sensitive glyphs that would reveal a path for Ibal to take across the chasm. Once across, the party had proven themselves able to embody the second and third tenat of Torm and were allowed into the third challenge.

This challenge, embodying the fourth tenat of sacrifice, saw the party pitted against monsters who could control their wills and force them to fight each other. How many will fall in the snow in this battle?

## 2022-01-10
Previously, on Protect Those who Cannot Protect Themselves

The party spent the better part of the day hiking around the Durrstaft Mountains. With the help of the resident Ranger, they avoided getting lost and made great time as they searched for the Hidden Temple of Torm. The group found a cave entrance that was protected by a golden-yellow forcefield. After some shenanigans involving just a bit of nudity, Liara presented herself to the doorway and dispelled the barrier. The party entered the hidden temple and passed the first challenge, a basic knowledge check of the tenats of Torm.

The party spied great claw marks in the cave wall on their way in.

Before entering the first challenge, the party found a plaque describing what they would find. They would be challenged 4 times. Between each challenge, the party would be permitted to rest as the time of the world stopped.

The party entered the first challenge. Their devotion to the first tenat, selflessness, would be tested here as they attempt to protect the image of a little girl in a crystal from stone golems and tentacle monstrosities.

## 2022-01-03
Previously, on Lemonese

The party got some more well-earned rest in Durrstaft. There were some shenanigans with the gate guards, but the party was allowed inside. Darquin discovered that one of his head waitresses had been experimenting with a new lemon-based drink that has proven to be very popular. Liara has a dream about her past teachings as a cleric of Torm. The party enjoys a night in the Snoring Owl and some good food at the Warm Boulder and discusses next steps.

The party wants to head to the hidden temple. They spend some time distributing loot before setting out.

## 2021-12-20
Previously, on Baby It's Cold Outside

Sophil, upon seeing the open sky above the coliseum, immediately attempted to fly away. She was brought back down with a force and an alarm was sounded. The party quickly surmised that the hatching stone crystals embedded in the wall were similar to the ones from the prison basement. They were enchanted to continuously cast Earthbind on Sophil, preventing her from flying away. The party set about destroying the crystals as the Durrstaft guards descended upon them.

Partially thanks to a well-rolled Wild Magic burst that turned EVERYONE INVISIBLE, the party managed to escape with the two silver dragons into the afternoon sky. Alistor flew the group to a remote location in the western Durrstaft Mountains where the group made camp and finally took a well-earned long rest. In the evening, the party spoke with Alistor about what to do next.

With no end in sight for Sophil's Feeblemind spell, the party offered up the names of Kellen and Thia. The party had previous experience with them and curse removal, and they'd be much more amicable towards curing dragons than anyone in Durrstaft would. Since Sophil is currently in no shape to travel, Alistor elected to remain with her for now, but offered up what information he could to repay his debt to the party. Alistor knows the location of the Hidden Temple of Torm. He knows that it is not usually guarded by any people, but that it is covered with enchantments meant to serve as a proving ground or a trail for Torm clerics looking to take the final steps in their religious journey to becoming masters. He also warns the party not to trust all the clerics of Torm in Durrstaft, as he felt another draconic presence while he was there. He's not able to remember specifically who, but he does remember that at least two of the clerics had green eyes. The party remembered that Anguisa was defeated within the hidden temple (retcon, sorry) and that it is likely that the group that defeated her made some use of the temple's defenses to aid them in the battle.

With a little more help from Alistor, the party is able to chart a path through the mountains back to Durrstaft.

## 2021-12-13
Previously, on We're Really Tired

The party managed to dispatch the soldiers in charge of guarding Sophil, but it was a close thing. Once they were done, Fran verified that the guards upstairs were busy fighting something. They had most likely ran afoul of the Ice Trolls the party encountered. Now relatively undisturbed, the party took stock of their surroundings.

Sophil still wasn't moving. The party eventually deduced that the two red crystals were Hatching Stones set to continuously cast Hold Monster on her. Destroying them freed her. She almost turned and attacked the party, but was pacified by an unusually high Persuasion check from Alistor. She appeared to be under the effects of the Feeblemind spell, reducing her to one step above a mindless beast. Alistor managed to convince her that the rest of the party are there to help her, but short of a Greater Restoration spell, Feeblemind lasts a minimum of 30 days after it successfully takes hold. The party isn't going to be able to get Sophil to transform, so they have to get her out through the large gate.

The large main gate was locked with a tandem lock, requiring keys to be turned and mechanisms to be activated in multiple locations around the room at once to be opened. The party made relatively short work of the lock and found themselves outside in the cold once again. The door opened out into a coliseum littered with frozen corpses. Putting two and two together, the party deduced that the Durrstaft guards had been using Sophil as an execution tool.

Now, tired and running low on magical energy, where to next?

## 2021-12-06
Previously, on Dracophobia

The party very skillfully snuck through the Durrstaft prison, and even managed to stage a convincing distraction by leaving the knocked-out bodies of two guards next to the hole they made in the prison wall. At least one guard and a guard captain saw this as a sign of intrusion, but given the nature of the cave, were likely to assume it was some wild or less-than-intelligent creature. Hopefully, they don't run into those Ice Trolls snacking on frozen lizard.

During their venture towards the down staircase, Fran recognized one of the prisoners as Poddrick Mosrii, a male dwarf and old friend from back when Fran was first learning to fish. The two of them effectively taught each other how to fish through making mistakes for each other. Poddrick quickly caught on that Fran and friends were here on a potentially illegal mission, and agreed to keep his mouth shut after Fran threw him the jail keys.

The party made their way down to the "special level" and found a giant room completely bereft of prison cells. Whatever this place is, it seems solely dedicated to the great silver dragon at the center. Alistor recognized the frozen creature as his sister, Sophil. There was no outward sign indicating why she wasn't moving. She hasn't been turned to stone, she's not covered in ice, she's just.... still. It wasn't long before her guard came out and proceeded to deal with the intruders.

## 2021-11-29
Previously, on Don't Touch My Meat

In a harrowing series of events, the party:
1. Ran in to a pair of Ice Trolls finishing up a meal
2. Managed to not antagonize the Trolls
3. Ran in to a Frost Salamander prowling for it's next meal
4. Narrowly avoid being frozen and turned into said meal
5. Kill the Frost Salamander
6. Use its corpse to appease the Ice Trolls so they could work in peace

The party located the abutting wall of the prison, and through some creative illusion work by Alistor, manage to break in unnoticed. Ibal took out one guard and the party started exploring the Durrstaft Prison. Alistor recognized the area the party entered as the "normal" level of the prison. He knows the way to the locked door that supposedly leads down to the "special" level. Now all the party has to do is sneak past the guards.

## 2021-11-15
Previously, on Swinging in the Rain

The party met up with Alistor at the south gate to Durrstaft. He was making small talk with some of the guards, explaining that he was heading south on a religious mission and that the party was his bodyguards. The city guards were relieved since the Frostfall pass was rumored to be very dangerous lately. The party made their way south, until their route took a sharp right and around a short gap onto a wide ledge around the mountain. A hilarious climbing adventure and some walking later, and the party found the entrance to the former Gnoll Cave. They entered, discovered some loot hidden among the leftovers of the Gnoll Camp, and fought a few monsters, making their way through the frozen cave.

## 2021-11-01
Previously, on Double Ds (Dwarves and Dragons, you dirty-minded heathen!!)

The party was introduced to the various clergy at the Temple of Torm. There was Alistor, a dwarf male and effectively their tourguide for the evening. Jarrek, a young human male and quiet acolyte seen sweeping the alter after worship was done for the day. Marloth, a matronly dwarf woman and decent chef. Eberk, Travok, and Harbek, a set of young dwarf triplets and serious troublemakers, by the look of things. And Shani Longspotter, a young female human with a cat named Pads who appears to have a small crush on Alistor.

The party met with Master Nathan, the human patriarch of the temple, but he was less than receptive to their request to learn about the hidden temple. He dismissed Valmar's claims as a miserable joke, Thunderwaved the group away from his door, and shut himself in for the night.

All was not lost. Alistor, upon learning that the party was involved with Viserion and Anguisa, told the party that he could help them find the hidden temple, if they would only help him rescue his sister from the Durrstaft prison. He thinks she's being held with the "special" prisoners. Fran remembered an old mentor of his, Durin Ironfist, who used to be a revolutionary and might know a thing or two about breaking people out of prison. The party paid him a visit at his blacksmith shop.

While there, it was revealed that Alistor is actually a silver dragon in disguise. Durin was less than enthused about that prospect, so Alistor waited outside while the party discussed plans. Durin was more than happy to help plan a caper that would stick it to the man in any way he could. He told the party of a hidden cave where a tribe of Gnolls used to live before they were cleared out a few decades ago. One of the walls inside the cave butts right up against the prison wall. Going that way would at least get the party inside with all their gear intact. Durin sold the party several sets of climbing gear, and everyone finally settled in for a long overdue rest.

The next morning, the party met Alistor by the south gate of the city and set off to find the cave.

Previously, on Death Becomes Him

Through several well-played abilities, the party managed to scrape by the battle with the Hag, Garlan, and the Snow Mutant. Garlan swore eternal vengeance against Valmar before his soul dissolved. His nature as a Revenant guranteed that to be a genuine threat, but Valmar/Liara at least have some space to breathe for the moment. The party took a short rest before resuming their journey to Durrstaft.

Upon arriving at Durrstaft, the party encountered more than one sign that this city is not as kind as the ones they've been to previously. The road leading to the main gate is littered with frozen corpses buried beneath the snow, and the party caught a glimpse of a person fleeing a volley of arrows across a frozen lake only for them to disappear suddenly. The party spoke with the gate guards and declared that their business was to visit the Temple of Torm. There was some mild hostility, but the party was allowed into the city. Asking for directions proved to be a chore, but they eventually made their way to The Warm Boulder for a hot meal and met Darqwin Kegblade, a dwarven artificer, who had apparently put some of his knowledge to use in sprucing up The Warm Boulder's kitchen equipment.

While the party was eating, two other clerics of Torm arrived: Gunnolda Frostbeard and Alistor Grassroot. Liara immediately spilled her life story to them, which put off Gunnolda until she mentioned that the paper written about Liara was written by Gunnolda's cousin, Baern. Gunnolda did not like the mention of Baern's name, but appeared more engaged with Liara after that. The party had a pleasant meal shared with their three new dwarven friends before setting out for the Temple of Torm.

Previously, on Bumps in the Snow

The party took a trip *up* memory lane as they ascended through the Durrstaft Mountains. They encountered several landmarks from their previous journey up the mountain, including the bloody remains of an owlbear nest near the frozen river. A way-too-sudden blizzard forced the party to make camp in the Frostfall Pass. The blizzard ended almost as suddenly as it began. The party's watch was tense as they saw things moving around the mountain and heard eerie laughter on the wind.

As morning approached, the party decided to go on the offensive. With Fran and Ibal in the lead (Ibal safely hidden among the snowy trees), the party made their way towards the end of the pass, where they were ambushed by a dread party of snow creatures: a Bheur Hag cackling on her flying staff, three Skeletal Owlbears, the familiar Snow Mutant, and one Garlan Hido, the red dragonborn druid, formerly of the Red Drakes, now risen as a Revenant and bent on revenge against Valmar/Liara.

Things aren't looking too good for our heroes....

Previously, on Family Matters

The party had a minor brush with death as they dealt with the crazy C.H.U.M. and saved Rhys' artificery shop. Once they were done, an ungrateful Rhys berated Ibal for finally returning home only to venture out again right away and not stopping to see their parents. Alannia found her component pouch and the party left in a huff. Alannia gave them a fond farewell as she cast Teleportation Circle and sent them all back to Loftran.

The party was greeted by Kara and Marsh Hansen, who prepared a nice lunch for them and asked about their adventures. The party paid the Hansens up for the next 5 months and commissioned that a stable be built for Karl the Emotional Support Ox. With logistics at home taken care of, the party went shopping. Fran and Ardin bought some new armor from Twinsplate while Theryn reconnected with the Hatching Stone miners and procured a set of Filtration Suits for everyone, in the hopes that they'd be somewhat protected from the acid breath of a black dragon. Ibal tried out Tabitha's latest creation in the bath, and learned how silly some of her experiments can get.

With warm food in their bellies and a good night's sleep behind them, the party set out for Durrstaft. They camped out in the foothills of the Durrstaft mountains in Ardin's Tiny Hut. The night passed uneventfully, except for Valmar having a strange dream about a red dragon that called him a murderer. The guy just can't catch a break.

Previously, on Hot Pursuit

The party fished Professor Adran Galonodel out from under the ruins of his lab. His arm had been broken. The party discussed the recent events and compared notes. They determined that Viserion now had the materials to cast True Resurrection and revive Anguisa, provided he could locate the site where she died. They also determined that his eventual plan is to perform some sort of reanimation ritual on the bones of Draffnir for some unknown purpose. According to legend, the bones of Draffnir are able to defend themselves somewhat, which matches the accounts that the party heard from the Grippli about the site where the Finger Bones are said to be buried. But something happened to them and their defense was shut down. Adran promised to put together an expedition to go to the Grippli village and help excavate the ruins in the hopes of determining what happened there and maybe switching the bones back on.

Meanwhile, the party needed to figure out where Anguisa died, since the True Resurrection spell has a higher chance of success if cast at the site of the target's death. The party woke up Hope of the Deathbringers, since they remembered that she had a written account of the actual battle. The party learned that Anguisa was defeated by a mix of Deathbringer warriors and Torm clerics battling on or near a sacred temple dedicated to Torm in the Durrstaft Mountains. Liara knows of the temple, but wasn't advanced enough through the clergy to have made the pilgrimage. And with her entire order massacred, the party would have to ask the elder clerics living in Durrstaft. Fortunately, it is likely that Viserion also doesn't know where the temple is located.

With a vague destination in hand and a good night's sleep, Ibal led the party back to the Ivory Tower to meet his sister, Allannia, an accomplished wizard and potions teacher in the Tower. They found her having breakfast in the school cafeteria, where she promptly ambushed Ibal and doted on him for a bit while hearing of his adventures. She was more than willing to lend her aid by teleporting the party to their circle under the Eloreth Manor in Loftran. However, she had forgotten her component pouch at Springs, Sprockets, and Servants, the artificery shop owned by her and Ibal's brother, Rhys.

The party set out at a quick march to the store, along the way admiring the artificers setting up the lengthy track for the clockwork cart race that marked the last day of the Stoneheart festival. When they arrived at the store, Rhys was unveiling his newest product, the Complete House Manager, or C.H.U.M. The party watched the demonstration as this massive clockwork octopus performed various tasks around the shop, until it was tasked with changing a Hatching Stone light in the ceiling. The creature crushed the stone, and the small energy surge that sparked out was enough to cause the C.H.U.M. to go haywire and start wrecking the shop.

Previously, on Frog Friends

The party spent some downtime helping the Grippli rebuild their village and excavating the temple ruins. Based on everything they had heard, they concluded that the artifact known as the Middle Point Ring is buried under the Grippli Temple. The Middle Point Ring very likely referred to the Giant Finger Bones of Draffnir, and therefore also referred to the "Finger Bones x3" that was on the list the party found. Through a conversation with Amelia, the party learned that the temple emitted a "pulling" sensation that made sentient beings think of the area as hallowed or homely. The Grippli settled here hundreds of years ago, but then something happened several months ago and that sensation went away. According to Splurgl and the other Grippli, "It just didn't feel like home anymore." The party excavated a little bit, and discovered two Yuan-Ti magical items in the sarcophagus in the top floor of the temple: Serpent Scale Mail and the Serpent's Fang longsword, both appeared to be important to the Yuan-Ti, but didn't have anything to do with the Finger Bones. Fran concluded that excavating the bottom floors of the temples would take weeks, so the party elected to return back to the Heavenly Cay and leave the bulk of the excavating to the good Yuan-Ti and the Grippli.

Before they left, the Pond Mother and the rest of the Grippli showed their thanks by performing a ritual of friends on the party. When they awoke, everyone in the party could speak and understand the Grippli language.

The party made their way back to the Heavenly Cay, very cautious about running into dragons. Theryn has his Lantern of Tracking (Draogns) lit and scanned almost their entire route to the Ivory Tower. Having Valmar around made that a bit of a challenge, as even the soul of Anguisa was setting the lantern off. Turned out that challenge allowed Rion to slip out to run an errand without being scanned by the lantern. The party concluded that the grounds were free of dragons, and made their way to Professor Galanodel's office. Despite the late hour, the professor was more than happy to perform the extraction procedure. He had only ever performed the operation on possessed individuals before, in lieu of an exorcism, with great success. The operation was a success, with Valmar only taking a small amount of damage and Liara's essence escaping unscathed.

However, once the soul of Anguisa was completely extracted and held in a treated Hatching Stone, Rion revealed himself to be Viserion, the black dragon and Anguisa's mate. He picked up Anguisa's new vessel, started reverting to his dragon form, scoped up Fangs his lizard, and broke through the wall and out into the night sky. But hey! At least Anguisa is out of Valmar's head now.

Previously, on Snake Bacon

The party enjoyed a small feast, courtesy of Splurgl's foraging skills, before they sailed upriver to the Old Grippli Temple. There, they found several oppressed Grippli working as excavators, moving rocks out of the temple. Inside, the party found the last squadron of Yuan-Ti, attempting to open a sarcophagus inside the temple. The party dispatched the Yuan-Ti Abomination and his henchmen. Before the last one died, he attempted to send a message to Viserion, explaining that their efforts to excavate the Middle Point Ring had failed. Ardin deftly counterspelled the message, and Valmar turned the Malison into the crispiest piece of bacon the party had seen yet.

The party investigated the room, and found that the partially open sarcophagus held a blade and armor of some kind, but the party was mostly in favor of letting sleeping artifacts lie. They did take the Lantern of Revealing and the Chime of Opening though. Valmar remembered that the "Middle Point Ring" refers to the Finger Bones of Draffnir the Giant, one of the great giants who created the world. The party might also remember that "Finger Bones - Seacracker Islands" was on their list.

The party left the temple, satisfied with a job well done. They had a large dinner at Splurgl's house, spent the night, and awoke the next morning to be greeted by the Pond Mother and the Grippli refugees returning from the outpost. The Pond Mother asked that the group stay one more night so that they could be thanked properly.

## 2021-08-30
Previously, on Cocoon

The party made a beeline for the Brooding Pools, determined to dispatch any Yuan-Ti lingering there and take back control of the pools. Sure enough, they found a sizable Yuan-Ti squadron waiting for them, lazily snacking on the eggs. A fight ensued, during which one of the Yuan-Ti revealed himself to be the further-mutated Caleb, a horrible prison guard from the party's past. Revealing himself quickly turned out to be a bad idea as the party focused all their firepower on making sure this asshole didn't live to see another turn. With his last breath, Caleb ordered one of the other Yuan-Ti to "do it". Apparently, that meant destroying the Grippli eggs, as the Yuan-Ti pulled out a vial of poison and dumped it in one of the brooding pools, killing the unhatched young inside.

The party dispatched the rest of their foes with litte effort and only a few scrapes. After some emotional moments, calm settled on the battlefield. The crabs will feast tonight!

...on the corpses of Yuan-Ti, mostly.

The party also remembered that both the good and the evil groups of Yuan-Ti were interested in the ancient temple to the north-east of the village. It's likely that there are still some Yuan-Ti there.

Previously, on POP, SQUELCH, SQUISH!!

The party entered the Grippli village and encountered a sleeping Yuan-Ti guard. They also spied a couple Grippli children who reacted with extreme fear upon seeing the guard. With their aptitude in sneakiness, the party knocked the guard out without issue.... and then promptly fed him to the starving crabs in the maze. Theryn conversed with the Grippli children, and learned that there are other powerful fighters being held prisoner in the Pond Mother's home. The party dispatched the other (lazy) Yuan-Ti guards roaming the village with relative ease, and then made their way into the large building.

The party alerted the Yuan-Ti inside, but also quickly dispatched them. Inside the rooms of the upper floor, the party found a group of Yuan-Ti prisoners who came with the first group (the good group). They also met Splurgl the Patient and Amelia Vandervelt. After some introductions and a few magical mishaps, the party remembered that the Yuan-Ti have been eating Grippli Eggs, and prepared to go kick some ass.

Previously, on Are You Sure You Can Sail?

The party meets Brocc at the port in the Heavenly Cay. After some discussion, Brocc lends the party the Folding Boat and expresses his full confidence that the party should be able to handle themselves at sea. Confidence that is very quickly shattered as the party scrapes the boat against the dock, loses the wind, and nearly beaches the boat on shore. After losing nearly an entire day of sailing, the party manages to find their way to the Grippli Trading Post.

Once there, the party is taken to see the Pond Mother, the matriarch of the Grippli people in this area. She tells the party that a nice group of Yuan-Ti arrived at the Grippli Village around a month ago. They believed that something important to their deity, The Scaled Mother, was located beneath an old temple near the village. Seeing no reason to refuse them, the Pond Mother granted them permission to excavate the lower floors of the temple. Over the next two weeks, the benevolent Yuan-Ti were true to their word and became good friends with the Grippli. But then, an evil group of Yuan-Ti warriors arrived. They butchered many of the Grippli, ate their eggs, captured or killed the nicer Yuan-Ti, and drove the Pond Mother and many of the villagers from the village. The Pond Mother and most of the villagers took refuge at the trading post. She begs the party to save her children from the evil Yuan-Ti.

The party took their boat and made their way towards the village, but first, they'd have to navigate the Crab Maze. The Grippli breed and harvest crab for their blood and meat, but it's been two weeks since anyone has fed the crabs. Failing to be sneaky, the party fought their way through the crab maze, showing their prowess enough that the crabs mostly left them alone, despite Carl potentially being the best meal they'd have in days. The party arrives at the breakwater, the lagoon, and finally the Grippli Village itself. There are a few small boats moored here, and the party can see armed Yuan-Ti roaming around the village. No one has raised an alarm.... yet.

Previously, on BACON!!

Fran escorted Rion and the two oxen to the stable to be returned. Rion got lost a couple of times, much to Fran and Verna's fury. Fran noticed something ever so slightly off about Rion's demeanor, but it vanished as quickly as it occurred. Fran decided to purchase one of the oxen from the stablehand, and named the beast Carl.

Back at the Purple Lotus, Professor Galanodel and Valmar were discussing Valmar's "condition," when the rest of the party noticed a blond man eavesdropping. Upon the mention of a "dragon spirit," the man hurriedly left the Purple Lotus and fled across town. The rest of the party chased him (or his scent), and eventually caught up to him outside a mercenary guild hall called The Gilded Shield. The man waited outside for someone. The party was approached by a female tiefling who asked what they were waiting for. It turned out to be Hope, the lead recruiter for the Deathbringers. She invited the party inside where Fran immediately left to fill a plate with meat and make friends with the blond man, whose name was Vesimir.

In a lengthy discussion with Hope, the party learned quite a bit. Previous Deathbringers had taken part in the ritual to defeat and seal Anguisa the Anguisher, for she had discovered a way to preserve her soul on the Material Plane after death. With the help of some metallic dragons, the clerics of the Deathbringers were successful in sealing Anguisa in a vessel that was then left in a cave in the Durstahft mountains. Hope had gotten word several weeks ago that the vessel had been unsealed (thanks, Valmar), so she prepared for the worst..... which never came. The question of where Anguisa's soul was went unanswered, until Valmar stumbled into the Deathbringers Headquarters. Hope also revealed more about the nature of Anguisa's mate, Viserion, who was behind the murder of the Elmwall family and the cultivation of a secret garden underneath their mansion. She looked over the list the party has, and pointed out that half of the list is things that would be needed to resurrect Anguisa. The other half described the locations of the bones of Draffnir, the Giant who created the continent, but Hope couldn't say what for. She also hasn't the faintest idea what the Abyss could be relevant to, but decided to leave that question for another day.

For the moment, the party is on a quest to procure giant crab meat, and find out why the Heavenly Cay hasn't gotten any in the past month. Not only is the meat itself incredibly delicious, but the blood of the giant crab is what Professor Galanodel requires to make his tracking agent, the first step in his extraction process. The party now needs to charter a boat and sail south to the Grippli trading post. They need to find out why the frog-people have stopped communications and trade with the Cay.

## 2021-07-26
Previously, on Really Large Animals

The party acquired a few new magical items while rummaging through the driftwood during their last day in Seacracker Isles. They managed to escape being eaten by a school of killer whales, but just barely. The next morning, the Sea Spear finally arrived at The Heavenly Cay.

It is the middle of Stoneheart, the summer solstice festival, in the Cay. The festival is characterized by lavish parades, food stalls, and the exchange of newly created gifts. The Cay also has a small population of Warforged and Modrons, effectively clockwork people and small creatures. Being a city made up of mostly magicians and artificers, this is pretty natural. Krusk tells the party to enjoy the festivities, since the Sea Spear won't depart for Loftran again for another month.

The party follows the sounds of music and crowds and manages to find a good spot for viewing the parade. After marveling at a few of the floats, Ibal recognizes one float being captained by Professor Adran Galanodel, the man the party is looking for. Unfortunately, almost immediately after seeing him and his skeleton-puppet float, the pyrotechnic float behind it explodes and causes the oxen pulling Adran's float to panic and rampage. After some skillful maneuvering, the party manages to calm the oxen and avoid a great deal of collateral damage, no thanks to Adran's assistant, the halfling Rion Blackspice.

Fran elects to help Rion take the oxen back to the stable they were rented from, while the rest of the party follows Adran to the Purple Lotus restaurant to discuss what to do about Liara/Valmar's condition. Adran muses about how his "blood essence extraction process" could be adapted to extract "soul essence" instead, but laments that he is out of treated giant crab blood, and needs it as a detecting agent. Without it, his instruments are not able to isolate the target essence for extraction. Not only is Adran out of the blood, but none has come into the city in a while. Something must have happened to the supply chain.

Previously, on Battles Aquatic

The party climbed out of the cistern and cult hideout underneath the Black Rose Inn, and had a lovely midnight snack with Cecil and the Brisly's. Everyone eventually retired to their rooms for the remainder of the night, except for Ibal, who finished up his trance and then came dowm to wash the dishes before Cecil woke up. Ibal noticed a small graveyard on the outskirts of town that now has a beautiful bush of black roses, bringing a close to the tale of Eliza Long.

At breakfast the next morning, Victor Brisly gifted the party with 5 flasks of Holy Water, sure that they'll come in handy during future adventures. He also gave them a letter of recommendation for the Deathbringers, a guild of undead-hunters based in The Heavenly Cay. Victor and Naomi are both members. They told the party to seek out a Tiefling named Hope, should they wish the services of the Deathbringers or to inquire about membership. Nell noticed the shade of Anguisa behind Valmar, which prompted Victor to admit that Nell might be able to sense undeath around her. With those thoughts chasing them, the party set off aboard the Sea Spear again.

While traveling down a long and wide strait, the Sea Spear stumbled into a trap. The end of the strait was blocked off with rocks, and two roughly-constructed capstans were turned behind them, raising a giant chain and blocking the way they had come. A berserker raiding party attacked the ship from their rowboats. Through some explosive attacks and deft aim with the siege weapons, the party taught the berserkers that they were a group not to be messed with. The crew of the Sea Spear passed around compliments to the party and thanked them for their help as the Sea Spear sailed down an alternate route.

One day out of port at The Heavenly Cay, Captain Krusk called for the anchor to be dropped. Lily the Lookout had spotted enough debris in the water to constitute a shipwreck. Sailing tradition dictates that they have to investigate. At best, there might be survivors to rescue. At worst, there might be treasure to salvage.

Previously, on Undead Idiots

Due to having the foresight of bringing a cleric into a crypt, the party made relatively short work of the Eternal Scions and successfully laid the soul of Eliza Long to rest. She imparted her blessing on the party before departing for the afterlife.

The party then proceeded to clean up the other loose ends they had found beneath the Black Rose. They destroyed the hanging skeletons without suffering any damage and scored the Bracers of Defense, which were given to Valmar/Liara. They found a set of disappointing treasure chests, containing only a handful of silver and copper. That is, until Fran and Theryn discovered a secret passage that led to the real wealth of the Scions. All told, the party found 2000gp in the chests in that room. The party then decided to make sure everything was set down here and opened the coffins that were in the last room. They found them empty, but Ibal recognized the names inscribed on the coffins: Irvenson, Moldavia, Bartov, Argovian, and Tulisse. They belong to noble families of The Heavenly Cay. He also recalled at least one of them had a member disappear around 50 years ago, around the time Eliza also went missing, according to Cecil.

With the cult destroyed and the crypt cleaned up, the party climbed the stairs to rejoin Naomi, Victor, Cecil, and Nell in the main tavern room of the Black Rose Inn.

## 2021-06-21
Previously, on Why Is It Always Cults?

The party was woken up in the middle of the night at the Black Rose Inn by Nell's voice calling out for help in the hallway. When the party opened their door to investigate, Nell appeared possessed. She hissed at the party and fled down to the tavern's main area. The party followed and found Nell cowering under a table and Cecil robotically cleaning a glass. Attempting to talk to Cecil did no good as he grabbed his weapons from behind the bar and attacked the party. He did significant damage to Ardin before Liara realized he was possessed now instead. Liara forced the apparition out of Cecil's body, after which it attempted to intimidate the party and fled into the basement.

A now lucid Cecil explained that the previous owner of the inn told him of the legend of Eliza Long, a woman who was captured by a cult and sacrificed beneath the inn. Her ghost now roams the halls at night, searching for her daughter and seeking vengeance against her killers. Cecil volunteered to guard Nell while the party investigated the basement.

Beneath the inn, the party discovered several spooky rooms. A previously locked door in the main storage room led to an abandoned cistern, and then to the meeting place of the Secret Order of the Eternal Scions. Liara checked through some of their parchment, and found that everything written about immortality and vampirism was complete hogwash. Nothing here would accomplish anything, save to motivate greedy individuals to make a sacrifice of an innocent girl, and possibly anger the real god of death. The party investigated further and found the unconscious bodies of Victor and Naomi Brisly, Nell's parents. The party quickly gave the Brisly's medical attention. Once conscious, the Brisly's admitted that they are vampire hunters who came downstairs after detecting an undead presence. Eliza caught them by surprise, possessed Victor, and forced the two to fight for their lives. Naomi and Victor believe that Eliza just needs a proper farewell to be put to rest.

Meanwhile, Theryn discovered a chasm with several skeletons suspended over it in cages. One of them was wearing a shiny bracer. After a failed attempt to lasso the bracer, which triggered a spooky wind, Theryn resolved to come back after the more important crisis was dealt with.

The party and the Brisly's entered the last room in the basement, and found the long-dead corpse of Eliza Long, along with 5 expensive-looking coffins and Eliza herself. Eliza was staring mournfully down at her skeleton when 5 zombified corpses crawled out of the ground and attacked the party.

Previously, on Flotsam and Jetsam

The party set off aboard the Sea Spear. They were introduced to the crew, a friendly sort, except for Candice the cook. They set about their tasks for the journey to The Heavenly Cay. The journey would take about 10 days.

After a day or two of easy sailing and fair weather, the party ran into a flock of Harpies, which were easily dispatched or chased off. The next day, the ship encountered a whirlpool, and Captain Krusk decided to make a final test out of it. He had Fran take the wheel as his final exam to becoming a "real" sailor. Fran passed with flying colors, navigating around the whirlpool without damaging the ship. That night, the crew held a party in celebration. A party that was crashed by Frammel, The Stubborn, an adult bronze dragon who lives in the area. Frammel took on a human form, provided some entertainment, and then sat to converse with the party. The party learned that Frammel's father helped create and perform the ritual that sealed Anguisa, The Anguisher, an a mystic urn. Liara confirmed with Valmar that he did indeed find an urn and somehow released the dark thing that lived inside. Frammel stuttered through shocked disbelief, claiming that his father would never make something that could break so easily. Frammel left in a huff, exchanged pleasantries with the captain, and left the next day with a barrel full of shiny trinkets and a new story to tell.

At around sunset on the 5th day of the journey, the ship made port at Bluerim Village, a waystation located on an island almost precisely in the middle of the archipelago. The village has a thriving tourist trade, but it's best feature is the Black Rose Inn, owned by an ex-gladiator half-orc named Cecil. The party purchases food, drink, and rooms for the night. They meet a small religious family, the Brisly's. Naomi, Victor, and their daughter Nell, who are also staying the night.

A storm rolls over the village as the party goes to bed for the night. It promises to be a long one indeed.....

## 2021-06-07
Previously, on It's a SNAAAAAAAAAKE!!

The party had several very fruitful weeks of downtime. Much research was done and a couple new friends were made. Liara receives a vision about frogs and snakes.

On the last week, Theryn and Ibal cornered someone who had been tailing Theryn. It turned out to be Daniel Mitsk, a Yuan-Ti afflicted person who wants nothing to do with Zehir and the ritual. All he and his brother, Zerdan, care about is getting their mentally-afflicted mother, Cazra, out of the city. Ibal and Theryn agreed to help. After visiting the Mitsk's house and talking it over, they settled on attempting to sneak Daniel and Zerdan to the House of Sunlight so they could be cured of their affliction.

After a few mishaps in the sewers, the group encountered a leftover Yuan-Ti Abomination, still loyal to Zehir. The party quickly dispatched it. The rest of the journey went smoothly, and the ritual was a success. Daniel and Zerdan were restored to humans and had a joyful reunion with their mother. Cazra, in a moment of lucidity, asked after their sister, Kristen. She, unfortunately, had completely succumbed to the transformation ritual and had been killed by the guards after the party defeated Sisava.

With another victory under their belts, the party made ready to set sail aboard the Sea Spear. Their destination, The Heavenly Cay, in the hopes of finding someone to help deal with the Anguisa problem.

## 2021-05-24
Previously, on Liara and Ibal go to White Castle

The party had a very fruitful first week of downtime. Ibal bought everyone fancy new clothes for the Makaria Resurgence Party, which was good, considering they were given a heroes welcome as the Ivy Slayers when they arrived at the party. The group met some old friends, including:

* Bart, the groundskeeper and his new cat Pine
* Baelor, the winemaker, who was very eager to show off his three new vintages, and defended them fiercely against naysayers and critics
* Bel'Krell, the head butler of house Makaria
* Aiden Collander, a human wine merchant who the party met in the House of Sunlight, and tipped the party off that Makaria needed help with her Mimic Ivy problem
* Eldon and Faldren, two halfling brothers that the party met waaaaaaay back in session 1, who now make a living as art dealers
* Makaria herself, the lady of the house, who thoroughly enjoyed the evening, and appears to have taken a liking to Theryn

The party performed admirably at the archery contest, with Ibal taking the grand prize of 6 bottles of Baelor's new vintages, 500gp, the Stormbow, and an Astral Shard. Theryn managed to earn the consolation prize of 3 bottles of wine and 300gp, but was gifted the Stormbow by a very humble Ibal. The party danced the night away (most of them anyway). Fran drank Dagnal Fireforge under the table and had to help her to her aids. Theryn honored Makaria with a dance. Finally, Ibal and Liara had a rather special evening and were the highlight of the dance, much to Liara's embarrassment. The party found their way back to Eloreth Manor for a night's rest. Valmar will eventually find that he has a party favor in the form of this new Astral Shard (which I've already added to his inventory on DNDBeyond).

Previously, on White Collar

Baern's experiment failed pretty miserably, but he got enough readings and information to write the beginnings of his paper. He presented Valmar with the Earring of Containment, which should boost the power of the Mind Cage spell that Valmar has been unconsciously casting on himself with Liara's help. The boosted spell should last a few months, given how successful Valmar and Liara have been at containing Anguisa so far. Baern then begrudgingly recommended that the party seek his old academic advisor, one Professor Adran Galanodel, at the Ivory Tower in the Heavenly Cay. Professor Galanodel was one of Ibal's science professors. He specializes in humanoid biology, just like Baern.

The party returned to the mansion for some much-needed rest. Valmar/Liara experienced their first dreamless sleep in weeks. Everyone woke to the smell of a glamourous breakfast prepared by Kara Hansen. There was a lot of discussion about hiring help to look after the house, but after reviewing the existing applicants and turning away one shifty dragonborn, the party made the decision to hire the Hansen family permanently at the rate of 25gp/month (once their week of initial employment runs out). This brings the total cost for maintaining the Eloreth Mansion to 40gp/month. 25 for the Hansens, 10 for food, 5 for misc supplies.

Ibal set out in the morning to open a bank account and have signet rings made to the Hansens would have access to money while the party was out adventuring. After making an initial deposit of 100gp, he discovered that the Eloreth household has 20,000gp in an open bank account. If the party can find an Eloreth signet ring, that money can be theirs. Fran and Ardin found a fantasy GNC called Kelleck's, owned by one Warwick Kelleck. After navigating around the "herbal" remedies and getting to the good stuff, they restocked the party's supply of healing potions. Liara bought 900gp worth of diamonds (actually spending only 850gp), good for 3 castings of Revivify. Finally, Liara and Theryn made their way to the docks to investigate chartering passage to the Heavenly Cay. They found Krusk, the half-orc captain of the Sea Spear, and his first mate Brocc. It took some convincing, especially with Liara being so..... open about her condition, but Theryn managed to secure passage to the Heavenly Cay aboard the Sea Spear for 40gp per person (Pumpkin rides for free as an "Emergency ration". Valmar and Liara count as one person). The bad news is that the Sea Spear doesn't depart for a month.

Since the Earring of Containment will likely last much longer than that, the party has decided to take advantage of what is effectively a "vacation" and have a little fun in the city.

Previously, on How to Train Your Dragon

Garlan of the Red Drakes was determined to take the Black Dragon Egg from Tabitha's "special package" back to his druidic monastery to ask his elders how to destroy it. He firmly believed that dragons are abominations and cannot be allowed to exist in this world, much less as a supply to someone as intelligent as Tabitha. Unfortunately, Garlans' plans were cut extremely short. After a fitful night of rest, Valmar and Theryn were intensely curious to see the egg for themselves. Upon laying eyes on the egg, the mostly dormant soul of Anguisa the Anguisher within Valmar broke free of the mind prison that Valmar and Liara had been keeping her in (unbeknownst to LITERALLY EVERYONE), seized control of Valmar's body, and attacked the party. Garlan, Theryn, and Ardin fell to the creature before Liara managed to wrest control back and force Anguisa back into the mind prison. Anguisa left some cryptic words about the egg being her offspring and about how the party will eventually encounter her mate, who will end them. Liara recalled a quote from some of her own research into their condition; a wizard who attempted to hold a demon in his own mind cage recorded his last thoughts in his journal, "clearly, one mind is not sufficient."

After a great deal of debate over what to do with the egg, the party decided to finish delivering it to Tabitha, as she had given them the impression that she was expecting only an egg shell and was surprised to find that the package contained a viable dragon egg. Tabitha said that she has no intention of hatching the thing, only to continuously harvest shavings of the outer egg shell, which will regenerate so long as the dragon inside is alive. The party said goodbye to Bruga, then accompanied Thalia back to the Wizard's College, hoping to get some more information on Liara's condition.

As chance would have it, the party ran into Professor Baern Frostbeard, one of the heads of Biological Research at the college. Excited by the opportunity to examine such a unique specimen as Liara/Valmar/Anguisa, Baern called on his assistant, Geoffrey, to wake up the rest of his staff, and he led the party to his main examination room. He asked Liara to lie down on the examination table, eyes gleaming as thoughts of his doctorate ran through his mind, and he started fastening the restraints....

Previously, on Game Over, Man!!

After some careful preparation and a few well-rolled stealth checks, the party made mincemeat of the monstrosity that had been stalking them since they arrived in Frostfall Pass. The creature fled, clutching to it's one remaining hit point. The party then discovered the laboratory of the deranged alchemist, Karina, and her imperfect monstrosities. A battle ensued. Valmar and Theryn were slain, with Theryn being sent from the realm of unconsciousness into true death for a brief time. Fortunately, the imperfect monsters that were providing a buffer to Karina couldn't live very long outside of their vats with no nutrient feeding tubes attached. Sensing the tide of battle shifting, Karina attempted to flee her cave, only to be brought down by Ardin's Cone of Cold spell.

The party gathered the remaining Red Drakes and what gear they could find of use in the lab. They found the "special delivery" that Tabitha had sent them for, with Garlan taking a special interest in keeping a hold of it. Thalia, Bruga, and Garlan held a small funeral for Iovus, their remaining member, who had been tied up outside and left to die of exposure after having his teeth and tongue removed. Ardin then impressed them with a warm and dry place to sleep for the night at the foot of the Durrstahft Mountains.

Ardin identified the vials and goggles the group retrieved from the lab. Ibal sent a status update to Tabitha, who replied and asked about the status of her package. Ardin, Ibal, and Garlan opened the box and discovered what appeared to be a fully intact Black Dragon Egg. Questions abound.

Previously, on What's This? What's This? What the Fuck is This?

The party made their trek up the Durrstaft Mountains on their way to Frostfall Pass, taking the reverse route that the Red Drakes would have taken to get to Loftran. The threat of a blizzard loomed in the sky. During the climb, the party encountered a frozen river guarded by "white people." After some shenanigans getting across, the party discovered an owlbear whose eyes had been brutally removed. Theryn successfully calmed the creature and conversed with it via a Speak with Animals spell. The party learned little, other than it was severely traumatized. The party moved on and discovered a body wrapped in a Red Drake cloak hanging from a tree and spinning in the wind. Fran got his leg caught in a bear trap, and the party discovered that the body belongs to a dear. After several more hours of hiking, the party finally made it to Frostfall pass and discovered the Red Drake encampment, along with the body of Iovus, the human rogue member of the mercenary band, and Verna, the extremely rude spirit of a dwarven shield maiden inhabiting a wonderfully crafted warhammer.

After a night's rest in the Tiny Hut, which was disturbed by some creepy noises outside, the party discovered what looked like an owlbear cave, with Thalia, the tiefling mage member of the Red Drakes. She came rigged with an explosive vial, but was promptly Revivified by Liara. She pointed the party at a secret door at the back of the cave, which the party discovered hid all kinds of gruesomness. Among other things, the party discovered Garlan, the dragonborn druid and third member of the Red Drakes. That just leaves Bruga, Verna's owner and a half-orc fighter. Before the party could explore further, the creature that had been stalking them finally showed itself: a four-legged patchwork creature the size of a car.

Roll initiative.

Previously, on I've Got A Hole In My Pocket:

Many things were done! Ibal was acquitted of his crime after presenting all his evidence to a very grateful Kathra Dankil, a clerk in the queen's office who loved getting things off her to-do pile. He took one of his old wanted posters as a souvenir. Theryn enjoyed a nice little walk around the castle and made some new friends. Ardin bought everyone a set of stylish winter clothing from Threads & Thrashings, and some lumber and tools to make a dropbox. Fran and Valmar hired the Hansen family to watch their house for about two weeks while the party is out adventuring and waiting for other applicants to come in. Liara earned her passage into the Forbidden Section of the Wizard's Library and researched her "condition." The party bunked in for the night in a manor that's feeling more and more like a home. Liara had a nightmare about an army of snake people made of darkness threatening her before Valmar stepped in and saved her. He turned to face a growling darkness and told Liara it was "her turn now" before pushing her through a door of light.

The next morning, the party received the final piece to the puzzle of the mysterious room: The name of the Brownie, Pepper Orangepearl. The door opened to reveal a wizard's dream workshop (bigger on the inside), with books and magical equipment scattered everywhere. On the other side was a teleportation circle that could be used to teleport back to the manor from anywhere by a spellcaster powerful enough to know how. Finally, on the far wall was a sinister black scorch mark with remnants of demonic energy still wisping off of it. After some exhaustive research, the party discovered that the scorch mark is most likely the remains of a portal to the Abyss. Maybe the Eloreth family had wizards who opened the portal themselves and vanished through it. Maybe something *pulled* them through. Whatever the case, Liara and Ardin determined that the portal remnants are not dangerous unless someone foolhardy attempts the ritual again.

The party packed up and set out for the mountains around Durrstaft. They were bound for Frostfall Pass, the last known location of the Red Drakes and Tabitha's mysterious "special delivery". Tabitha described the Red Drakes as a four-person mercenary band: A human rogue, a tiefling mage, a half-orc fighter, and a dragonborn druid. After a hard, but manageable, hike up the switchbacks of the mountains, the party encountered a frozen river.

...and heard growling amidst the trees.

Previously, on Women in Wine Cellars:

The party successfully rescued Isabella Elmwall from the wine cellar of her estate and escorted her and her remaining staff to the House of Sunlight for treatment. While there, she gave an account of what happened to her. Archebald made a "new friend" in Visera, an elven woman with piercing green eyes. Visera quickly wormed her way into the heart of Archebald and their sons. She was very interested in purchasing land, but seemed dissatisfied with all the prospects around Loftran that Archebald showed her. She convinced Archebald to build her an alchemical garden under his own mansion, where she grew powerful magical flowers. Visera bewitched the family, imprisoned Isabella, transformed into her, and took her place. She eventually poisoned the staff, drove the sons to insanity, and had Archebald killed by his own children. Ibal meticulously recorded all this in a journal, and the party left Isabella and her staff at the House of Sunlight for treatment.

The party turned in for rest at their Eloreth Manor. Ardin identified the deck of cards as a Deck of Illusions. Valmar had a horrible nightmare involved with fighting a shadow dragon and being saved by a mysterious girl holding a divine light. The party woke up and discussed options. Ardin revealed some parts of his tragic backstory and relation to Anguisa's Skull from the list in the garden. The party discovered the second of the three passwords to open the mysterious door in the mansion ("Pepper Orange"). They then spent the day running errands: Theryn and Ardin put up an ad for a butler/housekeeper for the manor, Liara bought "sharp" leather armor for Valmar, Fran and Ibal bought food for the manor and treats for the Brownie, and Fran bought a new set of plate mail. The group met up at Tabitha's shop after Ibal received a note from Tabitha requesting the party's adventuring services and Theryn and Ardin wanted to see if she knew anything about the list.

After buying some healing potions and a Potion of Watchful Rest, Tabitha described the job. She had ordered something from Durrstaft, high in the mountains, and hired the mercenary group known as the Red Drakes to deliver it to her across the treacherous-but-speedy Frostfall Pass. The delivery was due three days ago, and Tabitha is worried about the possibility of her special "something" going missing. She said it could be used for dangerous things if it falls into the wrong hands. She offered 300gp per party member for successfully retrieving the item, or 500gp per party member if they manage to bring back any of the Red Drakes. She also threw in the offer of enrolling the party in her "continuous discount" program. Once a week, they can purchase a single item from her shop at a heavy discount.

The party agreed, but they still have quite a few things left to do before they set out of the city: Ibal has to present his case to the queen (and possibly cash in their favor), the party wants to learn more about the mysterious list, and they have to decide whether to wait for housekeeper applicants to show up or build a mailbox to receive applications.

And so we begin, inside Tabitha's Alchemy Shop...

Previously, on The World of Goo:

The party had followed the trail of clues from Ibal's murder case back to Elmwall Mansion, where they believed the real culprit to be a member of the Elmwall estate. They found the staff of the estate had all been poisoned and were mentally checked-out. The party found the hanged body of Isaac Elmwall, and encountered the insane and rambling Bartel Elmwall in the study. Bartel repeated the phrase "she made me do it" a few times, before vomiting up some black goo and transforming into a grotesque beast. After a battle, the party searched the study, discovering a handful of magical items, a love letter from Archebald to a green-eyed elven woman named Visera, and blueprints for a secret room to be built off of the wine cellar.

The party ventured down into the wine cellar (familiar territory, given all the sewers and basements the party has gone through so far), learned that the black goo used to be wine, and eventually found a horribly mutilated Isabella Elmwall, chained to a wall in the cellar. Her only memories of the past few weeks are of darkness and pain, and of anger at the woman Visera for invading her home and stealing her family away from her. The party did what they could for Isabella before curing the rest of the staff, three maids and a butler, and agreeing to escort the Lady Isabella across town to the House of Sunlight for better treatment.

Before they left, Fran, Ardin, and Ibal discovered the secret room. Within, they found a plethora of alchemical supplies and a garden with mysterious color-changing flowers. The garden was humming with magical energy. The dirt had been dug out in the middle, as if several plants (or one really big one) had been harvested. Finally, the trio found a list of items (mostly body parts) and locations, some of which were crossed out. A name was also present on the list, Anguisa.
