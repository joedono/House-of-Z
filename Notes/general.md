## Creation Story
Something involving giants roaming the countryside. Many things in the world have to seem “bigger” than they should be. Ancient ruins should look built for beings 20-30 feet tall or more. Some of their skeletons still dot the landscape, although only the smaller ones are recognizable. The reason there’s so much magic and energy running under Loftran is that the largest giant of them all died, and Loftran is where its heart used to be.
