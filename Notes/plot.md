## Overarching Plot
Viserion is trying to cast a spell to resurrect the giants of old, who formed the world and warred over the land before the time of man. Doing so will visit untold destruction on anything small, including mankind. He needs a number of things in order to perform the ritual.
- A large quantity of magic, from a source related to a giant - Spiritwell Flower grown in the Heartswall District **GOT**
- A living direct connection to the giants - Blood of King Samuel of Loftran **GOT**
- Knowledge and Talent to cast the spell. Needs to resurrect his mate, Anguisa
    - Her skull was the keepsake/charge of Ardin's people **GOT**
    - Her soul was sealed hundreds of years ago, and currently lives in Valmar
- Something from the plane of the undead, the Abyss, to convert the energy stored in the flower
- A real connection to the giants - Any number of numerous bones left by the giants

The actual list that the party found:
- **Anguisa's Skull - Kornith Forest**
- Anguisa's Soul - Durrstahft *vessel missing??*
- **Loftran Leyline Magic**
- Abyss
- Pelvis - Third Finger Peak Mountain
- Finger Bones x3 - Seacracker Islands
- **Blood of the Giants**
- Spine - Mount Stratha
- Skull - East of Southspark?
- Ribs - Lindenvale?
- Other Bones - Unknown

For Anguisa's soul, Valmar and Liara have been taking turns fighting it inside Valmar's head when they switch out. After they're exposed to anything having to do with Viserion, Anguisa will start to fight harder, making herself more known to their conscious minds. They'll start to feel like they've just been somewhere else when they switch, rather than blinking and suddenly being somewhere new in the real world. They might start to feel exhausted or triumphant when they switch, as if they've just suffered a terrible defeat or had a wonderful victory. They might even start to hear Anguisa's voice from time to time. She'll be furious and determined to escape. She'll also be the main reason for Valmar's condition.

The **reason** Viserion is trying to resurrect a giant is so that it can be used in a war that Tiamat, the chromatic dragons, and their followers (including the Cult of Zehir) are fighting against Celestials and the gods. We're channeling Claymore, Hunter X Hunter, and Attack on Titan here. The world is a **LOT** bigger than the "little" island that has Loftran on it. The rest of the world is an unforgiving, hostile place. The sort of place that other mythologies refer to as the Age of Legend. It's happening now, but it's to big for its effects to be felt by the smaller folk in Loftran.

## Giant Bones
In order to reconstruct the giant, enough essence must be gathered from a giant's remains to re-corporealize it. The bones are scattered throughout the world, usually buried deep beneath the earth and indistinguishable from normal rock. The bones are semi-sentient, and can sense imminent discovery long before it actually happens. This will trigger the bones to defend themselves, usually with large sweeping effects that may not yield success right away. They're not the smartest things in the world, but they can create complex effects.

The Skull, located East of the town of Southspark, has mistakenly sensed imminent discovery for hundreds of years, and generates chaotic wind currents to defend itself. This has certainly discouraged travel through the area, but has also attracted Air Elementals, Cloud Giants, Flying Snakes, and other aerial hunters. The ever-presence of these airborne hunters means that the Skull always feels threatened, and thus always generates tornados and winds.

The Finger Bones, located in Seacracker Islands, south of the Heavenly Cay, have the ability to influence the mood of nearby creatures. When the grippli occupied the temple and village, it emitted encouragement and happiness, enticing them to stay where they were and giving them the impression that their temple was sacred and should be protected. The grippli interpreted this energy as that of Eldath (sister of Mielikki, Ardin's patron). So for hundreds of years, the grippli dutifully guarded the temple, oblivious of what truly remained sleeping beneath it.

Another bone, has a different problem. This bone can generate convincing illusions: terrain, objects, people, animals, etc. A roving band of monsters camped too close to the bone's resting place, so it generated illusions of stronger monsters to chase them away. The real monsters wound up pledging loyalty to the illusions, and raided the nearby human settlement with bolstered numbers. The bone generated illusions of human reinforcements to try and chase the monsters away, but then the monsters retreated *closer* to the bone and the humans followed. The bone generated more monster illusions, and so on. The town and the monster settlement are now more illusion than real, and the bone shows no signs of coming up with another solution.

Other bones will have similar world-altering effects. Take inspiration from Control and the SCP Wiki.

"Resurrecting" one of the bones will effectively cause it to manifest as a "normal" giant of some sort. It'll wreck havoc on the world until it is put down or put back to sleep. Once enough of them are resurrected, they'll assemble at a specific location, merge, and transform into the actual Giant they were part of.

## Abyss
In order to bend the resurrected body of Draffnir to their whims, the dragons need to fuel it's heart with chaotic evil energy. They need an Entropy Crystal from the Abyss, which is essentially equivalent to a Hatching Stone in the Material Plane. Such energy is volatile, but extremely easy to direct and motivate. It is also one of the only energies that will be able to prevent the soul of the **real** Draffnir from returning to inhabit his body.

## Party Motivation
In order to get the party motivated to actually go and check up on the other bones, have the bone in chapter 9 contact them through an illusion once the conflict is resolved. Explain that it can sense that its siblings are broadcasting distress signals. Some are stronger than others, but all are in danger. With the conflict around this bone resolved, it can reset itself and properly deal with the threat from Viserion, should it come around.

Now the stage is set for any number of outcomes for future conflicts. Viserion could beat the party to harvesting the bone essence, the party could beat Viserion to resetting the bone's defenses. They could arrive together, or the party could come into conflict with one of Viserion's henchmen.
