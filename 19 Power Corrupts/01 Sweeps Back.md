# Sweeps Back
The party has managed to return to the Sweep Citadel with their cargo of Frozen Hell Metal intact. Blast will be eager to finally finish his work on the furnace for his airship. It will take 4 days to construct the thing. Hopefully, the party dealt with the conflict in the Valley proper, or they'll have an attack on their hands during the downtime. Ensar's newly restored essence will last that long.

## Construction Complete
With construction of the airship complete, Blast is ready to get the heck out of dodge. The airship is big enough to carry roughly 50 creatures and their gear. Blast has a crew already picked out. The party will likely request that the airship's first stop be Skullmount to get Ensar taken care of.
