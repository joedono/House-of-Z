# Sweeps Back
The party has managed to return to the Sweep Citadel with their cargo of Frozen Hell Metal intact. Blast will be eager to finally finish his work on the furnace for his airship. It will take 4 days to construct the thing. Hopefully, the party dealt with the conflict in the Valley proper, or they'll have an attack on their hands during the downtime. Ensar's newly restored essence will last that long.

## Downtime
With 4 days of downtime and no immediate threats, the party can leisure around the Sweep Citadle and see what else the small city has to offer.

### Locations

#### Blast Hanger
Blast and his staff don't NEED any help in assembling the furnace, but they'll take any help offered by the party. They can use intelligence, skematic managing, and physical labor from anyone who volunteers. Players can make any skill check to contribute to one of these things. Blast will reward players who successfully contribute.

Rewards
* Spell Scroll of Aura of Vitality
* Spell Scroll of Bane
* Spell Scroll of Banishment
* Spell Scroll of Bigby's Hand
* Spell Scroll of Destructive Wave
* Spell Scroll of Dimension Door
* Spell Scroll of Dominate Monster

#### Alchemist Shop
The Alchemist Shop that had the Cloning Potion mishap is run by a half-orc named Alc. This will be as close to a "normal" shop that the party will encounter down here. If Fran comes shopping here, he'll set off an alarm. Alc will inquire about what curse or malady Fran is suffering from. If Fran is forthcoming with his werewolf curse, Alc will offer to cure him. If Fran doesn't enter, Alc will ask if anyone in the party is suffering from a curse or malady, and make the same offer to be passed along to Fran.

Another thing that might happen is the party will ask Alc to identify the starry potion they acquired from the Demilich. Alc's instruments will short out trying to identify it, but he'll be able to determine that it contains extremely powerful magic.

#### C.H.U.M. Construction
The goblin who ordered the C.H.U.M. has mastered its use and has been using it to run a one-goblin construction company. The party will notice that many of the dwellings look much sturdier and the obvious patches over random holes look much sturdier. Any check made to determine why the buildings look much better will lead the characters to the conclusion that someone is running a massive contruction company to get all this done in the handful of weeks since the party left. It turns out that Strut, the goblin owner of C.H.U.M. Construction, has been doing it all himself with his C.H.U.M.

There is no danger of the C.H.U.M. going out of control this time. Some of its tentacles have been enhanced with things like enhanced fortification for heavy lifting, a light, and several tools such as a circular saw, a welding torch, a multi-tool, and a hammer.

#### Light and Whizzbangs
This is the building that was housing the large laser that rolled around the street when the party was here last. It's owned by a white-haired bugbear and a kenku that have named themselves Light and Shadow. They're still working out the kinks in their large laser. It's not in danger of going awry unless the party attempts to aid in the construction and fail.

#### Illusionary Mettle
The kenku who spilled out the Deck of Illusions sold the remaining cards in the deck to a changeling named Mettle. He hates when people ask how his name is spelled, saying it's Bravery not Steel. Mettle has been making bets with children in the Sweep Citadel. If they can stand for 5 minutes in the pen with a random illusion creature without screaming and running away, Mettle gives them a silver. As the party is approaching, Stump is screaming and fleeing the pen, bringing laughter from the rest of Dent's kids, Bump, Grump, Pump, and Thump

#### Instant Farm
Acorn, the gnoll who accidentially caused a forest to sprout in the middle of the street, has *mostly* perfected his quick-grow formula and has made a killing selling spices and vegetables in a realm where nothing at all grows.

#### Trash Self-Pickup
Bits, the Firbolg who let a soul crystal accidentially animate a trash golem, has learned how to imbue **much** smaller amounts of soul into trash. This gives it just enough animation to walk itself to a cave that slides all the way down into a pit of lava from the Burning Wastes. Bits refuses to take payment, instead taking satisfaction in making Sweep Citadel a cleaner place.

#### Dent
Dent and Leaf are enjoying a quiet evening at home while their children are playing at Illusionary Mettle.

## Construction Complete
With construction of the airship complete, Blast is ready to get the heck out of dodge. The airship is big enough to carry roughly 50 creatures and their gear. Blast has a crew already picked out.

The party has two things on their todo list:
1. Get Ensar to Skullmount to hopefully find a permanent cure
2. Get the weapons and armor to the City of Zombies to outfit an army to storm Orcusgate
