# Zombie Army
The party has obtained a large cache of +1 armor and weapons. They plan to outfit citizens of the City of Zombies with arms and armor and use them to storm Orcusgate.

Garlan will be overjoyed that the party has lived so long, considering that it's been a couple months since he's seen them. The City of Zombies will be largely unchanged since the last time the party was here. Garlan is excited to get the army outfitted and mobilized.

## The Situation
Garlan, Ensar, Hairam, Blast, and the Party have some planning to do regarding their assault on Orcusgate. Their zombie army will number about 500 basically outfitted zombie soldiers (a +1 breastplate and a +1 weapon each). The party didn't get that much equipment from the Shadow, but with Blast and his engineers working on breaking down the steel, they can stretch the equipment and the extra metal brought from the Sweep Citadel to outfit 500 zombie soldiers. The airship can only hold up to 150 creatures, 50 of that is taken up by the crew and the party. So even fully loading the airship, at least 400 soldiers will have to walk to Orcusgate. It will take the zombies 6 days to walk to Orcusgate, since they don't need rest or sleep.

There are a few obstacles in the way of a walking journey though. The Chasme that guard the Deadlands will definitely harass the "unburied corpses" as they travel through the graveyard. The army will likely be able to handle them, but there will be some losses. The army will have to cross the River Styx at some point, and they're likely to either be swept away or lose all their flimsy memories if they try to wade or swim across.

If the party can't come up with anything, Blast will offer to have the airship function as an escort for the walking troops. It can use the ballistas and cannons to ward off the Chasmes and can hover across the River Styx and function as a sort of temporary bridge.

However, the party will have more to contend with once they reach the River Styx. As they arrive, they'll see Anguisa's army hard at work building a temporary bridge across the river, while also ferrying troops across on small rafts or being carried by flying demons.
