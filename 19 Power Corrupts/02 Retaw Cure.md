# Retaw Cure
The party is bringing King Ensar to Retaw at Skullmount in the hopes that Retaw will be able to do something about Ensar's soul leak. The airship makes this trip trivial.

## Orcusgate
As the airship passes over the Final Hills, the party can see the comings and goings of the various demons around Orcusgate. They won't be able to see into the city of Everlost as it will be covered by black fog.

A particularly perceptive player will be able to pick out Anguisa flitting around in Orcusgate. She will see the airship and fly up to have a look. She won't engage the party directly at this point as she's been ordered to wait until a bigger army of demons can be mobilized and sent out in a giant wave to further quell Thanatos. Instead, she'll make the party an offer. She's close to getting what she wants from Orcus, and she wants the party to stop interfering with her plans. She'll gift the party a stone that she's been carrying that has the Planeshift spell held in it. If pressed about how the resurrection of Draffnir will result in the destruction of the continent, she'll say that she has a way to make sure that no major population centers are destroyed during this event. This is a lie. The entire continent will be destroyed due to how deeply Draffnir's bones are embedded in the foundation of the continent. Not to mention that Anguisa makes no further promises that might spare the continent from becoming a target for annihilation later. It is a simple Insight check to expose the lie. Anguisa will retreat after this, swearing that the party will disturb her plans no further. She'll also retreat at the first sign of hostile action.

The rest of the journey to Skullmount will be uneventful.

## Skullmount
Ensar will be nearly empty of soul by the time the party gets to Skullmount. He'll wake up full of hungry energy when the party gets close. There are dozens of giant skeletons buried in the mountain of bones. They're a little more able than most to pull together their bones, but not nearly well enough to pull together a full body and break away from the mountain. If Ensar makes physical contact with the mountain, he'll be in danger of getting sucked in and becoming a lost bundle of skeleton pieces as well. The party will have to restrain him while they talk to Retaw.

Retaw will be overjoyed to see the party again. He was glad to see them before, but knew that mortals don't typically last long on Thanatos. They either die, go insane, or become enslaved. Retaw will be happy to share his essence with Ensar, considering Ensar a sort of nephew of sorts. The problem will be that the party will have to extract a piece of it from the heart of Skullmount. Considering that the bones of Skullmount flow a little like water, Blast will volunteer his diving bell for the trip. The bell has enough room for 3 people

## Diving Bell
The three stations in the bell are pilot, navigator, and engineer. The bell is equipped with claws all around it's body that can function to push the bell through dense materials, similar to how the Graboids in Tremors moved through the dirt.

The navigator is responsible for reading the instruments and directing the pilot where to send the bell. They'll be responsible for giving the pilot directions towards the heart of Skullmount, where the greatest concentration of soul is, as well as keeping an eye out for other pockets of increased soul density, which could indicate a more direct threat than the bumping and grinding of the smaller bones. This will be mostly Perception checks.

The pilot is responsible for steering the bell and controlling it's descent. They'll have to respond quickly and accurately to prompts made by the navigator to keep the bell on course and avoid any threats. This will be mostly DEX checks.

The engineer is responsible for repairing any damage sustained by the bell during its descent. This will be mostly STR, DEX, and INT checks.

The journey down is pretty simple. 2-3 masses of soul will attempt to attack the diving bell.

## The Core
The core of Skullmount looks like a large pink crystal. The diving party will have to break off a chunk of it to bring back to the survace. The diving bell is equipped with C.H.U.M.-like arms and a diving suit. One of the crew can attempt to manipulate the arms to break off a chunk of the soul crystal, but if there are too many failures, the arms might break, requiring someone to get into the diving suit and go out to get the crystal themselves. Being this close to a soul crystal will have similar, if accelerated, effects to those experienced by people in the lower floors of the Hatching Stone mines.

Stages:
1. Light itching on the exposed skin
2. Periodic "shinies" in vision, caused by small crystals forming and dissolving in the eyes.
3. Loss of feeling in extremities (disadvantage on fine motor skill checks)
4. Painful stabbing sensation just below the skin (1 damage per turn of combat or 1d4 damage per hour of non-combat)
5. Brain fog (disadvantage on WIS, INT, and CHA skill checks and concentration checks)
6. Crystal scaling (+1 AC)
7. Paranoia
8. Crystallization of limbs (half movement speed, -2 to attack rolls)
9. Crystallization of brain (surrender control of character to DM, point of no return)
10. Crystallization of heart (character death)

## Return Journey
The journey out will be more hazardous than the journey in, as the soul fragment the party extracted will make them a beacon for the half-formed souls inside the mountain. There will be 5-6 attacks, including some that will drag the bell deeper into the mountain or attempt to break inside. There may be actual combat involved if a leak happens

Once out and retrieved by the airship, Ensar will be completely drawn to the soul crystal. Upon consuming it, he will have a perpetual soul generator as part of his essence, never losing his lucidity and never going empty. It's not a direct fix to his leak, but it's almost as good. Ensar will pledge his abilities to the party's goals for the near future.
