# Power Corrupts
Upon arriving back at the Valley of the Crypt Things, and continuing the theme of undead power corrupting those who don't immediately shun it, the party finds that the Valley of the Crypt Things has been nearly completely taken over by Gail and Benni, who has transformed into a Sire of Insanity. Gail has fully succumbed to the nature of the Valley, and now desires only to expand his territory and control the entire valley. He has long since dropped his Disguise Self cover, and his flesh has started to slough off, revealing the skeleton underneath. King Sweep is the last bastion of territory not under the control of Gail, but he won't last long without some serious help.

## Entrance
The party enters the Valley of the Crypt Things from the north, putting them just barely outside of Gail's expanded territory. The last two bastions of resistance against Gail are the sewers, where the Balor lives, and Sweep Citadel. These two have caused Gail to continue to focus his efforts to the East and South of Eloreth's old base, leaving the northern quadrant of the Valley mostly untouched. The party have a number of possibilities for what can happen to them here.

## Meeting Gail
Gail's soldiers roam his territory. They've grown more powerful due to Baphomet's power working through Gail. They won't immediately be hostile towards the party, but they'll have instructions to bring any living creatures back to Gail's base. Gail gave that order when he first took the throne, in the hopes that it would save the party from immediately being attacked if/when they came back to the Valley. Gail's morality might have warped since the party was last here, but he remembers his friends.

If the party meets with Gail, they'll learn what happened since they left. The corrupting influence of Baphomet and the Valley itself started to work on Gail and Benni almost immediately. Gail grew more and more invested in the pointless war for territory in the Valley, and has started to transform into an Undead. Benni saw what was happening to his friend, and even his addled mind could tell he had to get away. Gail's soldiers easily imprisoned Benni in the basement, where Gail enacted a ritual that he thought would restore Benni's sanity and restore his loyalty. The ritual did make Benni loyal to Gail, but it also turned Benni into a Sire of Insanity, now the most powerful soldier in Gail's army.

Gail will ask the party to join his army and help trample the last dregs of resistance so Gail can be the sole ruler of the Valley. The party has a chance to convince him to abandon this quest, but they'll be working against Gail's Baphomet-driven desire for carnage and the corrupting power of the Valley. Their best chance will be to find Benni's old red cloak in the ritual chamber. That will remind both Gail and Benni of who they were and restore their moral compass. Benni will remain a monster, but he'll be considerably more well-behaved.

If things turn hostile, the party will have to fight their way out of the base and find safe haven.

## Meeting the Balor
The party might attempt to sneak through the sewers, or head there in pursuit of safety. The Balor has been severely wounded and is mounting a desperate defense in the sewers. The defense gives all the impressions of a powerful force, but is actually the last dregs of the Balor's servants. One big push could easily break their line. The Balor is eager to parlay with the party once it discovers their existence. It'll also recognize them by their scent. They were in its sewers before.

The Balor will want help shoring up the defenses in its sewers. The party can help put up barricades or capture some of Gail's dumber soldiers for "conversion". The Balor will absolutely not abandon its home.

## Meeting Sweep
The party might elect to attempt to sidestep the conflict altogether and go find Sweep. If they make it all the way to the southern tip of the Valley, they'll be able to find the Steel Door. The Steel Door was welded shut and held off any attempts to breach it so far. Gail will have had his soldiers construct a massive battering ram to try and break it down. When the party arrives, the ram will have broken for the fourth time and Gail's soldiers will be in the middle of repairing it. The Steel Door is in danger of buckling. One more session of ramming will probably knock it down. If the party manages to get inside the door without permanently damaging the ram, more soldiers will arrive to fix it and finally break the door down.

The party will have time to plan an approach.
