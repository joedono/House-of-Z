# Power Corrupts
Upon arriving back at the Valley of the Crypt Things, and continuing the theme of undead power corrupting those who don't immediately shun it, the party finds that the Valley of the Crypt Things has been nearly completely taken over by Gail and Benni, who has transformed into a Sire of Insanity. Gail has fully succumbed to the nature of the Valley, and now desires only to expand his territory and control the entire valley. He has long since dropped his Disguise Self cover, and his flesh has started to slough off, revealing the skeleton underneath. King Sweep is the last bastion of territory not under the control of Gail, but he won't last long without some serious help.
