# Battle on the River Styx
Now fully armed and armored and with an army at their back, the party makes for Orcusgate to defeat Anguisa once and for all. They meet Anguisa and the army's of Orcus on the River Styx. The demon army was partway through constructing temporary bridges and ferrying troops across the river. About a third of the army is across the river when the party's zombie army arrives.

If the party took their airship ahead to scout, they'll see the army marching out of Orcusgate south. Anguisa will have given the army directions, as she saw the airship flying East and deduced that they were heading to meet up with Garlan. The party might have a chance to kick-start the fight early, but the troops and armaments they can fit onto the airship won't be enough to handle the entire demon army. They will see bridge-building equipment and elect to focus on destroying that. The longer they stick around trying to harry the army, the more damage the airship is likely to take.

## Battle
Eventually, the two armies will meet in battle. Depending on what the party elects to do with the airship, the armies might meet on opposite banks of the River Styx or they might meet just outside of Orcusgate proper.

## Wand of Orcus
https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5428-wand-of-orcus

The Wand of Orucs is also in play. Orcus has lent the wand to Anguisa for this attack.

## Anguisa's Objective
She is bound to carry out Orcus' last order to enslave or destroy these adventurers. Once she does that, as long as she doesn't receive any more orders from Orcus, she can exploit a loophole in his latest orders. Orcus didn't order her to bring the party back to him, so once she destroys them, she's under no obligation to return to Orcus for new orders. She'll take the Wand, use the Planeshift stone to return to the Material Plane, and continue her work. If she ever receives new orders from Orcus, she'll be bound to obey them. But to her mind, fleeing to another plane is more than enough distance that she'll never run into Orcus again.

She'll also accomplish her own goal if the party returns to or is banished to the Material Plane. She'll immediately follow them, and put her orders on hold, as she's confident that they'll die if they're anywhere on Draffnir when he is awakened.

## Tactics
Anguisa's primary objective is the death or enslavement of the player characters. As the only living adventurers on Thanatos, Orcus wants them gone. Therefore, the majority of the army's effort will go into bringing the airship down or finding a way to board it. The demon army has numerous catapaults at their disposal, and they aren't shy about firing off flaming meteors or pockets of soldiers at the airship. Having never actually encountered an airship before, they might not have much of an idea how to actually combat it. They won't have rope or grappling hooks to fire up at it for easy boarding and they won't target the flight crystals or the balloons for the first few rounds of the fight. Anguisa might realize what makes the airship float and order a change of tactics.
