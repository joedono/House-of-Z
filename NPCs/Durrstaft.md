## Temple of Thorm

### Nathan Sarnol
Master cleric at the Temple of Thorm. A solemn and stoic human male. Practically ends every sentence with a religious idiom. An extreme believer in tradition and ritual. No exceptions. Has blue eyes.

### Jarrek Bestalt
Human male acolyte. 14 years old. The newest member of the clergy. Wide-eyed and very innocent. His parents sent him to the church to learn an occupation, but he doesn't know that they were executed as heretics. Has green eyes.

### Marloth Sethran
Female dwarf cleric. Around 120 years old. Only one year away from her full clergyship. Second in command to Master Nathan. Very motherly, but not blind to the corruption in the city. Has brown eyes.

### Eberk, Travok, and Harbek Battlehammer
Male dwarven acolytes. Triplets who are always seen together. Has grey eyes.

### Gunnolda Frostbeard
A distant cousin of Baern Frostbeard of Loftran. 72 years old. She doesn't particularlly want to be here, but another cleric of Thorm gave his life to save her, so she feels obligated to fulfill his duties. Has blue eyes.

### Alistor Grassroot
A male halfling. Actually a silver dragon in disguise. WAY too excited to be a cleric. Has green eyes.
