# Southspark

## Adventuring Party
Halfrek - Paladin male human
Raya - Rogue female elf
Juno - Sorcerer female human
Seebo - Cleric male gnome

## Wiesgart
Elf male and one of the town greeters. Likely the first to greet the party when they arrive. Way-too-happy attitude. Knows everything about the town and talks about the war with the monsters with as much enthusiasm as the latest trade gossip. Illusory.

## Peachy
Human female. Owner of the Leaky Boulder, the main tavern in Southspark. Looks around 13 or 14, way too young for the job of tavern owner. Took over the tavern after her father never returned from the war. Runs the tavern VERY well though. She's able to manifest her father's voice to yell at the patrons to calm down when they get too rowdy. Illusory. Has a pet cat named Sparkles that is NOT illusory.

## Fig
Peachy's father and the actual owner of the Leaky Boulder. NOT illusory. He is bedridden and dying of starvation, as none of the food Peachy feeds him is real.

## Farley, Marley, and George
Three human male brothers that make up one of the exhibition teams that go into the Finger Peaks to mine for metals. Farley is the short fast one. Marley is the average intelligent one. George is the big strong one. All are illusory. Also appear as the owners of the mess halls at Base Camp.

## Primdor
Male halfling. Troublemaking member of the Sky Delvers.

## Barnabus Craggletooth
Male brass dragonborn. Guildmaster of the Sky Delvers. Super serious, but super high-pitched voice.

## Riff
Male human. Owns Hammer and Nails, the carpentry and blacksmithery. Has a massive chip on his shoulder.

## Alvarin Mist
Female elf. Manages the Crystal Meltdown. Scatterbrained and constantly interrupts conversations to correct out-of-line workers. Gets around the refinery with misty step.

## Halden Bramhold
Male dwarf. Traveling merchant. The only real and healthy person the party is likely meet. Has been eating all of his own food in an effort to save money.

## Neep
Male goblin. Part of the original monster band that moved into the foothills. At some point, got herded into the deserted Temple of Innovation's basement. He's too scared to try to leave and get caught by the populace, so he hides in the basement and survives on rodents. He's nearly mad with hunger. He knows more about what happened from the monsters' point of view and will happily tell the party everything if they offer him food. He can tell the difference between real and illusory food though, so the party will have to be careful.
