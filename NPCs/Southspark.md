# Southspark

## Wiesgart
Elf male and one of the town greeters. Likely the first to greet the party when they arrive. Way-too-happy attitude. Knows everything about the town and talks about the war with the monsters with as much enthusiasm as the latest trade gossip. Illusory.

## Peachy
Human female. Owner of the Leaky Boulder, the main tavern in Southspark. Looks around 13 or 14, way too young for the job of tavern owner. Took over the tavern after her father never returned from the war. Runs the tavern VERY well though. She's able to manifest her father's voice to yell at the patrons to calm down when they get too rowdy. Illusory. Has a pet cat named Sparkles that is NOT illusory.

##
Peachy's father and the actual owner of the Leaky Boulder. NOT illusory. He is bedridden and dying of starvation, as none of the food Peachy feeds him is real.

## Farley, Marley, and George
Three human male brothers that make up one of the exhibition teams that go into the Finger Peaks to mine for metals. Farley is the short fast one. Marley is the average intelligent one. George is the big strong one. All are illusory.
