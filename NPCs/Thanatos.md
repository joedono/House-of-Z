# Thanatos

## General

## Skull Mount

### Retaw
A brother of the giant Draffnir. Fell here after his brother's death during the creation of the world. His bones make up Skullmount and are perpetually attempting to reassemble themselves. With the large number of bones from other creatures around, that task is proving impossible. Instead, Retaw's will to reassemble gives rise to patchwork skeletal creatures or his mishapen skull.

Retaw was one of the giants who was more interested in little creative endeavors when the world was forming, along with his sister Estoc. Retaw was directly responsible for creating humans in the first place, so he'll see the players as some of his children. He won't directly ask for their help. He'll see his plight as something beyond their capabilities.


## City of Zombies

### Garlan
Former member of the Red Drakes and Revenant bent on revenge against Valmar of The Rat Catchers. Garlan has found his new home as a risen undead on Thanatos. Due to an accident, he has been appointed king of the City of Zombies and seeks a way to overthrow Orcus. Since his vengeance was fulfilled as a Revenant, he'll feel no more ill will towards Valmar, but he won't be apologetic. He has a new purpose now, although he is profoundly ill-suited to lead, especially since the majority of his soldiers will be half-aware zombies.
