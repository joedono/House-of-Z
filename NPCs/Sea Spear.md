# Sea Spear

## Krusk
The captain. Half-orc male. Very serious, but takes good care of his crew above all else. Tolerates fighting, but only "officiated" duels to settle disputes or friendly competitions. Understands the waters, crew dynamics, weather, and management better than most.

## Brocc
First mate. Half-orc male. Reads Krusk very well and knows where his limits are. The perfect foil to Krusk's seriousness. Brings some much needed levity to the crew, but sometimes has to be reined in by Krusk when things get too rowdy.

## Harim
Second mate and helmsman. medium human male. Usually at the helm unless Krusk takes the wheel. Quiet and stoic, rarely talks. Likes to whittle, but has a habit of taking pieces of the ship for his projects.

## Lily
Lookout and navigator. Small female human. Can "smell" storms. Keeps a sketchbook full of pictures of creatures of the sea, but no one's quite sure which are real and which are fantasies. Will show the book to anyone who shows the slightest interest.

## Candice
Cook. Large female human. Actually hates seafood, so she keeps a library of spices to make fish taste like other things. Gets a lot of complaints from the crew such as "just feed me a bleedin trout, woman!" The crew is always joking with comments like this, but Candice responds seriously, usually by threatening to clock them with her pots.

### Folmon
Bosun/Engineer. Medium male elf. Has a persistent layer of sawdust or soot all over him. Has a tendency to talk to the ship, nicknaming it Sally. Usually, it's endearing, but most of the time, it's creepy.

## Respen
Surgeon. Skinny male elf. Cleanest one on the crew. Likes to read. Doesn't brag about it, but he's the best shot with the ballista that Krusk has ever known.
