## Ralovyre Family

### Father Folas Ralovyre (517) and Mother Chalia Ralovyre (456)
Ibal’s parents think he is going through a phase and expect him to fall in line with the study of magic, as "he certainly has the intelligence and attention to detail for it," at some point in the future. Be that as it may as he’s barely an adult (by elven standards) and they've allowed him his indulgences and his studies into the Psyche and Behavior.

### Elder Brother Rhys
Ibal's older brother took on the family trade and became a skilled artificer. Their relationship is professional, but being 322 himself, and old enough to have a child Ibal’s age (despite being unmarried); Rhys sees Ibal as a bit of an impetuous child. He often wonders whether their parents are being too lenient with Ibal, but generally trusts their judgement.

### Middle Sister Allannia
Ibal's older sister is an accomplished wizard and teacher at the Ivory Tower looking for less practical and more interesting uses for magic. As the middle child and in truth being closer in age (193) to Ibal than Rhys, Allannia is a doting older sister and perhaps takes the most interest in Ibal’s studies and interests.
