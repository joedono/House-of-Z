# End
With Anguisa finally felled, the party has a few loose ends to tie up
* What to do with the Staff of Orcus. They have an hour before Gail's Forcecage spell wears off
* Wrapping up the storylines of the NPC allies they've made while in Thanatos
* How to get home
* Wrapping up the long-neglected storylines back on the Material Plane


## Wand of Orcus
The Wand of Orcus will continue to pulse out necrotic energy at regular intervals unless the party does something about it. It only has a range of 500ft, so they could just leave it there to be picked up by a wandering demon. The wand will possess the demon to return the wand to Orcus, and the status quo will be restored.

Alternatively, they could throw it into the River Styx. It'll be washed downstream and potentially end up in another layer of the Abyss, prompting another demon prince to pick it up and see it as an opportunity to go to war with a weakened Orcus.

If the party elects to take it with them anywhere, it'll attempt to persuade them to wreck havoc and raise an army of undead.


## NPCs

### Ensar and Zeethrae
Ensar has no desire to return to the material plane, knowing full-well that he'd have a hard time overcoming any impression his appearance would give normal mortals. He believes his kingdom and legacy are in good hands. He'd appreciate any word the players can send about how his latest grandson is getting along with his combination of giantism and lycanthropy. "It's sure to produce amazing events worthy of the greatest bards" he'll say.

Zeethrae, fresh off the grief of losing her crew to Anguisa, but also freshly united with her "cured" husband, will elect to stay with him on Thanatos.

They'll return to the City of Liches and make another attempt at bringing some semblance of order to the rebuilding effort after the flooding and freezing that Rashaan's pact with the Daemogorth Titan inflicted on the city.

### Hairam
Hairam doesn't want to stay in Thanatos any longer than necessary. He'll pester the players to either send him back to Mount Celestia or take him with them to the Material Plane. If the players manage to get him to the Material Plane, he'll make the journey to Mount Stratha in order to pray for the return of his wings or forgiveness and welcoming back to Mount Celestia. He'll be denied both and wind up wandering the Material Plane, still doing his part to protect the land from dragons. He'll eventually get restless and wish he could do more, at which point he'll raise enough money to buy a ship and attempt to sail to the center of the ocean, where the war between the dragons and the angels spills out into the Material Plane the most.

### Blast
Blast will be EXTREMELY happy that his airship is now battle tested and found sufficient to tackle a horde of demons. He'll be eager to report this to Sweep... once he and his crew take a tour of Thanatos (staying clear of Everlost, of course). Sweep enjoy his security at successfully negotiating the safety of his kingdom with the Balor and enjoying life for a while. He'll then become slightly affected by the warring and conquering influence of the Valley of the Crypt Things as the other monarchs get resurrected. Sweep, however, will turn that energy and his new airship towards attempting to conquer Thanatos as a whole, becoming a new thorn in Orcus' side to keep his hordes busy for a little while.

### Gail and Benni
Gail and Benni have had enough of the Abyss and very much want to return home. Gail will entreat the players to find a way to cure Benni, to which Hairam will step up and use his Healing Touch to end the curse Gail placed on Benni and return him to his normal dwarvish self. Benni will also have all of his sanity restored, but his memories of the last few weeks will be hazy or missing completely. He won't remember being a Sire of Insanity. Gail and Benni will be very grateful to the party if they return them home. The two of them will settle down in Durrstaft.


## Returning Home
The party will be returned home at or near the point where they left, which puts them in the sunken tower known as Landgrave's Folly, 40ft underwater and a few hundred feet off the coast from the Heavenly Cay. 40ft is easily crossed in two rounds, which is more than enough time for each character to get to the surface. From there, they can either hang or sit on the portion of the spire sticking out of the water and wait for a passing ship, or attempt to make the swim back to the Cay. They'll encounter no complications on their way back if they swim.

## Ralovyre Family
Ibal will likely want to make contact with his family, since the whole reason the party was sent to hell in the first place was investigating the Lantern Ghost Murders committed by Ibal's brother, Rhys. Ibal's family will have given him up for dead, due to Allannia's attempt at casting Sending failing twice (an extremely unlikely possibility, but it can happen). As such, Allania will be overjoyed to hear that Ibal is still alive, as will his mother. His father will work very hard to contain his joy at having one son back among the living.

## Loftran

### Lady Eloreth
Lady Eloreth will not make a contest out of attempting to gain her old manor back. She'll instead use her signet ring to claim the reserve gold her family had in the bank and purchase the Elmwall Estate. She's living comfortably.

### Hansens
The Hansens will be excited to see the party again. They hadn't given them up for dead, instead assuming that they were on another adventure that took longer than most. Marsh will have moved out though. Now a teenager, he will have met up with Nell, Melanie, and Neep and begun their own adventures.

### Tabitha
Tabitha will have rebuilt her shop after King Samuel nearly destroyed it. Back to business as usual. She's cooking up a fresh batch of experimental potions to send to her experimental volunteers.

### Royal Family
King Samuel has been nursed back to full health after his run-in with Vartar the wizard. He has, with the help of Tabitha's alchemy, gained a measure of control over his new lycanthropy. He's now known by the moniker "The Great Wolf", a nickname he takes pride in, despite the fact that he didn't earn any of it. Princess Selise, is now taller than he is and has to duck to go through most doors.

Any stories shared by the party about meeting King Ensar will be met with amused indifference by all of the royal family except for Princess Marta. As the only member of the royal family not interested in royalty, she'll be enthralled by a story about her relative being a conquering hero, even if he did wind up in hell and was a pretty big blowhard.
