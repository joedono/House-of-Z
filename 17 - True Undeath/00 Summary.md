# True Undeath
Anguisa has flown through a portal to the Abyss created by the death of a ritually charged juvenile kraken. Her goal is to make it to Thanatos, the layer of the Abyss ruled by Orcus and a layer ruled by undeath. Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any creatures foolish enough to journey here.

Anguisa needs to obtain either:
- The Wand of Orcus
- The head of a sufficiently powerful demon to animate the body of Draffnir
- Some other magical item with enough powerful undeath energy to animate the body of Draffnir
