# Dragon Vengeance
A powerful dragon burned Ardin's village while he was away and killed everyone. Ardin may seem soft-spoken and kind, but he harbors a deep desire for vengeance against the dragon. During their first encounter in dragon form, Ardin will recognize Viserion's roar as the one he heard on that fateful day.
