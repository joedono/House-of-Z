# Illusory Army
A situation and adventure suitable for any non-city settlement nearby where a giant's bone is resting. The bones are fairly active in their own protection, and this one, now that it has been awakened, has been summoning illusions of terrible beast armies to keep people away from the area. The problem is that the threat from the monsters and wildlife has become so great, and the illusions so widespread in response, that the nearest settlement of people has encountered them.

## Possible Locations
- Pelvis - Third Finger Peak Mountain & Southspark
- Spine - Mount Stratha & Hazelton

But this can be adapted for anywhere. Just calibrate the response from the humans accordingly.

## Summary
A roving heard of something organized has moved into the area and is dangerously close to discovering the giant bone in the area. The group can be kobolds, goblins, orcs, maybe a hag leading a troupe of corrupted children, whatever. The point is, the pack makes up a small army that can have a variety of different types of fighters and beasts within it. The bone, upon sensing the imminent threat, produced illusions of stronger beasts to frighten off the pack. The fighting was fierce, with no regard being made for the fact that the illusions could not be harmed. The only harm that was made was from friendly fire, but it was enough to convince the pack that whatever they were fighting could harm them and they could not harm it. Rather than being frightened off, the pack pledged their loyalty to the illusions, still not convinced that they were not real. Since the threat remained, the bone conjured up illusions in greater numbers, until someone in the mob shouted that they should attack the nearby human settlement. The illusions followed suit, reasoning in their own primitive way that this might still be the best way to get the threat out of the area.

The attack on the human settlement was hugely successful, largely due to the pack's numbers being boosted by the unharmable illusions to the point of being basically an army. The fighting was fierce, and the pack/army was just barely fought back. The pack and the town have had regular skirmishes ever since. Resources are running low in the town, and no real replies have come from repeated calls for aid (this is due to the bone conjuring up illusions causing the messengers to get hopelessly lost).

With the threat from the pack not leaving, and the threat from the humans growing, the bone has no choice but to expand it's influence. Random illusions crop up in and around the town. Ghosts, plagued lepers, wolves, and bears. Anything it can do to scare the people away. Some leave, rendering the town a ghost town. Those that remain are either bunkered in their homes with dwindling resources, or driven mad, or both.
