# Ancient Text
From bio - I have an ancient text that holds terrible secrets that must not fall into the wrong hands

Liara's ancient book was lost when Valmer's magic went awry and merged them into his body. She'll have to search for it and keep it safe. She has a medallion left by one of the thieves. It has the mark of Zehir on it, which will eventually lead her to finding it among the Venomers, who are attempting to poison Loftran.
