# Quest Ideas

## Wizard's Final Exam
Cathlene's final exam is coming up in a few months and she needs help studying. Maybe take her on a quest to get some real world experience.

## Missing King
The king of Loftran is missing. The queen will impart onto the players a quest to go find him. He's been taken by Viserion, the ancient black dragon who was behind the Loftran transformation ritual as well as the destruction of Ardin's tribe. He needs the king for something in his blood. He's also behind the murder of Archebald Elmwall, the corruption of Isaac and Bartel Elmwall, and the torture and maiming of Isabella Elmwall. He's been masquerading as Isabella for months.

## Locked door in Eloreth Mansion
The mansion the queen of Loftran bequeaths to the party as a reward for saving the city has a door locked with a 9th level Arcane Lock spell. It can only be opened with the password. There is elvish script above the door that says:

Be ye friend or be ye foe?
Speak my name, or you'll never know.
Leave me a drink, or a plate of treats
and I'll keep your house nice and neat.

The required name is Pepper Blackpearl, and belongs to the brownie to lives behind the locked door in the residence. He'll only come out when the mansion is deserted, and if the party has left out treats, he'll clean everything. Each night that the party leaves out treats, he'll leave another clue to his name: pepper, a swatch of black fabric, and a pearl. Speaking the name will open the door and reveal a teleportation circle that the magic users in the party can memorize the sigil sequence for, an arcane laboratory with many books, alchemical supplies, a magic item or three, and the makings of a portal to...somewhere (the Abyss). This was actually what happened to the previous owner of the mansion. They opened a portal to the Abyss and disappeared through it.
