# Investigation

## Marsh's House
The first place the players are likely to want to go is back to Marsh's house. If they don't, Marsh will probably prompt them. After all, it was the last place he saw his parents.

His house isn't much to speak of. It's nestled in between other, slightly larger, houses down in Greensburrow. But at least it's a house. There's a main room that functions as a kitchen, dining room, and general living space. Marsh has his own room, but it's barely big enough for his bed. Marsh's parents have their own room with a closet. If the players look inside the closet, they'll find a small table with ornaments dedicated to Zehir: green-burning candles, a sigil scratched into the surface, a knife, and a small bowl with a small amount of dried blood in it. The biggest find will be a note with the words "Heartswall District. Linen Street. Come and be freed.", which should lead the party to investigate Linen Street in the Heartswall District (obviously).

## Linen Street
There are three buildings of note on Linen Street: a storage warehouse, The Softest Sheet (a textile shop), and a manufacturing building where the linen is made. Across the street from these three buildings, is a sigil of Zehir burned into the ground, making the area particularly dangerous to people not affected by the poison.

### The Softest Sheet
A dazzling array of colorful fabrics line the walls. Rugs, curtains, bolts, tablecloths, everything that can be made out of a square of fabric without cutting it more than four times. If the players inquire, there may even be a couple of magical rugs and coats in here too.

#### NPC - Linda Linen
Human merchant and owner of The Softest Sheet. Her way of saying hello is to evaluate and criticize or compliment a person's outfit. She has fairly obvious snake eyes, but isn't hostile to the players. Fashion and taste rule her world and her only enemies are those with poor taste.

Linda has a stack of pamphlets that she's been instructed to hand out to everyone. They advertise "having your sins washed away" by coming to the Linen Street Storage Warehouse. Linda remarks that she's seen a number of people going in and out of the warehouse at night, but doesn't care to learn their purpose. None of them leave with any textiles from the warehouse, so Linda doesn't care.

Before the players leave, Linda will hand out coupons for Threads & Thrashings, a clothing store that buys most of the textiles that come our of her shop, sews them into fine clothing, and sells them to the citizens of Loftran. They're good for 50% off a single purchase for a single person. She implores a couple of the party to please outfit themselves more....tastefully.

### Manufacturing Building
There isn't much of note here. People are sitting at sewing wheels and looms, making raw thread into linen sheets. The party will be basically ignored but politely asked to leave if they hang around too much.

### Storage Warehouse
The warehouse is abandoned during the day, the door tightly locked. The players can attempt to break in and look around, either through the door or one of the windows.

Crates and crates of cloth are stacked up everywhere, creating a veritable maze for the players to navigate through.

A DC 25 Investigation check will reveal a secret staircase protected by an arcane ward in a back corner. If the party manages to break through, they'll find the secret ritual room in the basement, but it will be empty. They'll have to wait until nightfall to see if Marsh's parents show up.
