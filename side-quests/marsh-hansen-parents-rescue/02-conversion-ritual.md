# Conversion Ritual
As night falls on Linen Street, the party watches for signs of Marsh's parents at the ritual site in the linen storage warehouse. As the warehouse has a sigil right in front of it, there is a decent chance that one or more of the party will be affected by it.

Players are level 3.

## Night Falls
If the players stake out the warehouse until nightfall, they will see a sporadic stream of people going inside the warehouse. At some point, they'll see a nice-looking couple leading a family of four into the warehouse. Marsh will identify the couple as his parents, likely spurring the party into action.

There will be a couple guards outside the warehouse, but it's possible the players will manage to deal with them in time to catch Marsh's parents before they go inside. If not, then they'll have to venture inside and deal with what's in there.

## Guards
1 Cult Fanatic - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cult-fanatic
3 Yuan-Ti Pureblood - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yuan-ti-pureblood

The guards will be welcoming at first, seeing the players as willing converts, or at least hapless saps here for fresh conversion. They'll be particularly eager since the players have obviously not been as affected by the sigils yet. Probably less so if the party brought too much artificial light with them.

## Entering the Warehouse
The secret staircase in the back corner of the warehouse stands open. If the party bluffed their way past the guards, they won't be harassed as they make their way through the warehouse. They'll have the opportunity to surprise the enemies in the encounter below down in the ritual room.

If the players fought their way in, then the encounter below will be waiting in ambush among the crates within the warehouse.

Either way, Marsh's parents and all the other citizen converts who showed up that night will be stashed in the ritual room. They will cower in fear if the fight happens in the ritual room.

## Battle for Rescue
1 Yuan-Ti Priest - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yuan-ti-priest
2 Yuan-Ti Broodguard - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yuan-ti-broodguard
2 Yuan-Ti Pureblood (optional) - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yuan-ti-pureblood

The Priest will attempt to flee if both Broodguards are defeated.

## Aftermath
Marsh will, of course, be incredibly thankful to find his parents. They'll tearfully embrace, claiming that they were worried sick about him, but the snake-eyes won't fade right away. Marsh will try to convince his parents to leave the city, but they'll be resistant. He'll look to the players for help. It'll be up to them, but if they attempt to force Marsh's parents to leave the city, they'll complain, but they won't be able to stop the party. Bringing the parents to the House of Sunlight will allow the clerics to restore them to their senses and they'll gladly leave the city with their son.
