- No reason to leave the city
- Too easy
- No supernatural angle. Just murder for money.

Ideas
Make Isabella a red herring. She's not scoffing at the vast fortune, but she doesn't have a head for business and is likely to lose all of it quickly without help

Makaria should remain a red herring. She might have been Archebald's main business rival, but she knows that the shortcomings of her business aren't because of him stealing her customers. She needs to fix up her own business before attempting to fight him seriously.

What if the Elmwall Estate is over the wound that killed the giant whose heart is giving Loftran all its prosperity? What if Isabella made a deal with someone to run the property into the ground, and then offer it for sale to the noble houses, and this mysterious patron would buy it cheap? Does Isabella really need a benefactor? Maybe she's just an opportunist and sees the murder as fortuitous instead of causing it on purpose. What if she IS the dragon? The real Isabella was kidnapped and the black dragon took her place weeks ago, duped her children into murdering their father by enthralling them, and is now letting the vineyard go to ruin as she rebuilds something underneath it?

So what could the black dragon want with the most prosperous vineyard in Loftran? Maybe there's a portal to the Abyss under it? Maybe it's the most concentrated single point of magical energy in the city and the citizens are unaware. If I'm going to make this the dragon, then whatever it's doing needs to be a small part of a larger plan. I think that it needs to find whatever it was looking for and flees the city, which should send the party on a chase around the world.

So the rest of the mystery stays the same, but the culprit is an imposter.
