# Elmwall Estate
The Elmwall Estate is similar to the Makaria estate: a massive property with a massive mansion and a prominent vineyard in back. Depending on how the party approaches this, they can either break in or bluff their way in.

Unfortunately, most of the staff has heard Ibal's description, but believe him to be dead, assuming the party hasn't encountered Isaac and Bartel previously.
