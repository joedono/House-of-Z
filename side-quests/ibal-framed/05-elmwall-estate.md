# Elmwall Estate
The Elmwall Estate is similar to the Makaria estate: a massive property with a massive mansion and a prominent vineyard in back.

Unfortunately, most of the staff has heard Ibal's description, but believe him to be dead, assuming the party hasn't encountered Isaac and Bartel previously. Eerily, the staff will be relatively apathetic to the party's presence. This is due to Viserion's influence.

## Entrances
The estate has a large front door, a back door leading in from the vineyards, and several first-floor windows. None of them are guarded or manned.

## Staff Encounters
Once inside, the party can encounter a number of staff members, all in a daze.

The head butler is a human named Stephan. He can be found slumped in the main dining room. He appears to be sleeping. If disturbed, he'll greet the party, offer to get them tea, then seem to forget their existence unless prompted again.

There will be three maids scattered around the mansion, two gnomes and a half-elf. They'll appear to be cleaning the same small area over and over again. They won't react to the party's presence.

A dog will run past the party. It'll have a large slab of meat in its mouth. It's on its way from the kitchen to it's "den" in one of the guest bedrooms. It's got free reign of the entire house.

## Family Encounters
Bartel is locked in the study. He won't let anyone in. If the party breaks in, he's feverishly packing paperwork, ledgers, and other documents. He's been driven to the brink of sanity by Viserion. If pressed, he'll basically admit to murdering his father, but he'll keep saying "she made me do it, she made me do it" referring to his mother. If he's questioned about where his mother is, he'll mutter "deep burrowing down dark scratching clawing dissolving", which will summon several rodent monsters from the walls. He'll then attack the party. After the fight, if the party examines Bartel's body, they'll find green discoloration under his fingernails and around his eyelids. These are signs of poisoning of some sort.

Isaac's body can be found in the master bedroom. He hung himself with a bedsheet from the chandelier. Examining the body will find similar and more severe symptoms to what Bartel was suffering from (green discoloration around the fingers and eyelids). Around the floor under Isaac's body are five wine bottles with the Elmwall seal on them. Three of them are empty.

Isabella herself is chained up in the wine cellar. She's been down there for about a month when the transformation ritual started, kept alive by Viserion as a source of information and a plaything. She'll have no idea that Archebald is dead or what the state of things upstairs is. She'll be in no state to offer more information than that right away. If the party takes pity on her, they can nurse her back to relative health over a long rest.
