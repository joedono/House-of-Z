# Carriage Driver
Isabella gave the carriage driver the night off the night that Archebald was murdered. The driver lives in a small apartment on the border of the Elmwall estate, next to the stables, with a wife and daughter. The party does not need to enter the Estate proper in order to reach the apartment.
