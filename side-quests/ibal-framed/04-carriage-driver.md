# Carriage Driver
The Elmwall carriage driver is a female dwarf named Riswynn. She lives in a cabin just outside the Elmwall estate next to the stables with her husband and two children.

Isabella gave the carriage driver the night off the night that Archebald was murdered. The driver lives in a small apartment on the border of the Elmwall estate, next to the stables, with a wife and daughter. The party does not need to enter the Estate proper in order to reach the apartment.

## Carriage Driver's Apartment
The apartment is empty when the party arrives. Riswynn is taking her family on a carriage tour of the city, a favorite past time of theirs. The party can investigate the stables, but they won't find much. They're well kept, with one horse grazing in a fenced-in field with a young colt. The apartment is locked, but easily picked.

Within the apartment, it's a nondescript home. There's a central living area with a dining table and a kitchen, there's a bedroom with two small beds in it for Riswynn's children, and a second bedroom with one larger bed for Riswynn and her husband.

There is a backdoor that leads out of the master bedroom and into the fenced-in area where the horses are.

## Clues
The one major clue in here is Riswynn's ledger. It'll have a schedule full of the Elmwall's outings and away-from-home appointments for the family. A couple sporadic days will be marked in purple and a few will be marked with green. The day of the murder is marked with purple. The party won't know this, but purple will indicate vacation and green indicates sick time.

## Arrival
Riswynn's carriage will pull up just as the party discovers the ledger. They'll have the opportunity to escape through the back door if they wish, or they can leave through the front and encounter Riswynn. She'll be incredibly suspicious, since Ibal matches the description that Lady Isabella gave of Archebald's killer, but she'll be uncertain. If the party plays their cards right, Riswynn will be willing to share what information she has, including the ledger if the party hasn't discovered it, as proof that she was given the day off by Isabella, hopefully cluing the party in to the fact that Isabella had a hand in orchestrating her husband's murder.
