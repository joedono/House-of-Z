# Framed
Ibal was arrested for murder and his victim's family still blame him for their husband/father's death. They'll stop at nothing to see "justice" done.

## Full Summary
Ibal was investigating a murder when he was caught with the body. The only reason the guards arrested him was that the witnesses said that the victim was beaten to death by an elven man matching Ibal's description. Ibal was arrested on sight and held in Hangman's Noose prison to await his trial date. The victim is one Archebald Elmwall, a prominent noble who earned his fortune running one of Loftran's extremely fertile vineyards. His family passed down a unique fermenting process that produced unique wine that seemed to age in half the time. Archebald is survived by his wife, Isabella, and his two sons, Bartel, and Issac. Being hugely successful in his industry, Archebald has at least one business rival, and two jealous "friends" whose own business ventures are failing. All have the motive to want him out of the way, and the means to hire such hitmen. The actual mastermind behind this murder is Isabella herself and her two sons. She never really loved Archebald, and only married him for his money. Archebald's family has a history of having weak constitutions. Isabella wanted to be the next in a long line of wives who married into the Elmwall family, survived their spouses, and inherited their fortune. Unfortunately, possibly due to the regular, but never excessive, wine consumption that Archebald partook in, his constitution never showed signs of deteriorating. Isabella grew impatient, and decided to lend fate a hand in ending Archebald's life. She arranged for Archebald to be alone in the alleyway, and had Bartel and Issac jump him and beat him to death. She counted on his other business rivals taking the fall and being able to play the grieving widow herself, while quietly celebrating her newfound fortune that she and her sons could enjoy.

## Victim
Archebald Elmwall - wealthy nobleman. Inherited his fortune and his family's vineyard. The unique properties of the soil causes wine made from the grapes to age twice as fast as normal, meaning it becomes more delicious sooner. The Elmwalls typically have weak constitutions and die relatively young, a fate that has spared Archebald so far.

## Killer
Isabella, Bartel, and Isaac Elmwall. Isabella married Archebald for his money, planning on taking advantage of his family's tendency to die young to inherit the money and the business for herself. Since Archebald does not actually have a weak constitution, she set him up and had Bartel and Isaac beat him to death.

## The Crime
Isabella gave the Elmwall carriage driver the night off and fed Archebald a fake story that she was ill. She had previously forged a party invitation to Makaria's estate and feigned exhaustion herself. This led Archebald to attend the party with Bartel and Isaac, but they had to walk. Along the way, Bartel suggested they take a shortcut down an alleyway, where he and Isaac set upon Archebald and beat him to death. Ibal happened onto the scene a short time later, hearing the commotion, and was witnessed examining the body. He was quickly arrested, but not before obtaining some clues as to the identity of the victim.

## Leads
Only a couple points of investigation will be available to the players at the outset.

They could head back to the scene of the crime, where they will actually find the murder weapon, a bloody cane, which would not be available to your run-of-the-mill hitman. This will point the finger at someone else of noble status, which should lead the players to suspect that it was someone Archebald knew. If they don't already know Makaria due to helping her with her Mimic Ivy problem, then they'll find the party invitation as well.

Isabella, Bertel, and Isaac will visit Ibal in prison and make a show out of grieving over Archebald's death and express joy that Ibal is going to be hanged for what he did. They might drop some more hints about Archebald's identity, such as his wine business and business rivals. Now that they know the name, status, and occupation of the victim, they have a few more avenues to look in to, hopefully leading them to find Makaria, Enna, and Seebo.

1. Isabella -> Business Rival - Makaria (female tiefling)
2. Bartel -> Jealous Friend \#1 - Enna Nailo (female half-elf)
3. Isaac -> Jealous Friend \#2 - Seebo Timbers (male gnome)
