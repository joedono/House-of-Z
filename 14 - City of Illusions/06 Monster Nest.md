# Monster Nest
The party has made their way into the ant-hill of a maze of tunnels that make up the monster nest. This close to the skull, the illusions will be even more unstable, giving rise to legendary monsters who may or may not engage the players.

## The Maze

## Skull Chamber
Before coming into the final chamber where Draffnir's skull is, the party hears rhythmic chanting in Goblin. None of the players speak it naturally, but anyone who can understand it through magical means hears

```
Oo, Draffnir. Slumber and sleep.
May your eyes watch over our dreams.
Oo, Draffnir. Slumber and die.
May your eyes watch over our dreams.
```

At the end of the maze, the party discovers the resting place of Draffnir's Skull. They see a large skull at the end of an underground river. The skull has bright white lights in its eye sockets and a cracked broken piece missing from its forehead. Closer inspection will reveal jagged claw marks around the hole and some greenish slimy substance. It's ectoplasm left by Anguisa.

The rhythmic chanting is Greep, a lone goblin in the middle of worshipping the skull in the middle of a circle of animal bones.

As the party enters, the white lights of the Skull's eyes will focus on them and the skull-masked boy will appear in front of them, "You finally found me."
