# Monster Nest
The party has made their way into the ant-hill of a maze of tunnels that make up the monster nest. This close to the skull, the illusions will be even more unstable, giving rise to legendary monsters who may or may not engage the players.

## The Maze
The maze bears sparse signs of settlement. The only things that have ever lived down here are the 6 goblins who settled down here. Animals and other sentient creatures don't come down here, so there are no signs of life. However, there are noises and shades moving around. Being inside the cave has made the party the primary targets of the automatic defense systems of the Skull. All the illusions that manifest will stare at them or attempt to attack them. They are all monsters. Goblins, Hags, Ogres, Kobolds, Young Dragons, Dinosaurs, Sphinx, Demons, Devils, Beholders, and all sorts of things.

## Skull Chamber
Before coming into the final chamber where Draffnir's skull is, the party hears rhythmic chanting in Goblin. None of the players speak it naturally, but anyone who can understand it through magical means hears

```
Oo, Draffnir. Slumber and sleep.
May your eyes watch over our dreams.
Oo, Draffnir. Slumber and die.
May your eyes watch over our dreams.
```

At the end of the maze, the party discovers the resting place of Draffnir's Skull. They see a large skull at the end of an underground river. The skull has bright white lights in its eye sockets and a cracked broken piece missing from its forehead. Closer inspection will reveal jagged claw marks around the hole and some greenish slimy substance. It's ectoplasm left by Anguisa.

The rhythmic chanting is Greep, a lone goblin in the middle of worshipping the skull in the middle of a circle of animal bones.

### The Boy in the Skull Mask
As the party enters, the white lights of the Skull's eyes will focus on them and the skull-masked boy will appear in front of them, "You finally found me."

TODO

### Greep
Greep will think that the party came to harm the skull, like that dragon did. The party has a shot at calming him down if they bring up his brother, Neep, and mention that he still lives. If the party doesn't calm Greep down, he'll turn up his chanting, and then throw a rock at the skull. This will cause the defense systems to acivate, and the skull will shroud Greep in the likeness of a Lich. If the party manages to calm Greep down, the Skull will activate anyway and manifest the likeness of a Lich on its own. Greep will retreat to a safe corner of the cave, but he might be caught in some crossfire anyway.
