# Monster Nest
The party has made their way into the ant-hill of a maze of tunnels that make up the monster nest. This close to the skull, the illusions will be even more unstable, giving rise to legendary monsters who may or may not engage the players.

## The Maze
The maze bears sparse signs of settlement. The only things that have ever lived down here are the 6 goblins who settled down here. Animals and other sentient creatures don't come down here, so there are no signs of life. However, there are noises and shades moving around. Being inside the cave has made the party the primary targets of the automatic defense systems of the Skull. All the illusions that manifest will stare at them or attempt to attack them. They are all monsters. Goblins, Hags, Ogres, Kobolds, Young Dragons, Dinosaurs, Sphinx, Demons, Devils, Beholders, and all sorts of things.

## Skull Chamber
Before coming into the final chamber where Draffnir's skull is, the party hears rhythmic chanting in Goblin. None of the players speak it naturally, but anyone who can understand it through magical means hears

```
Oo, Draffnir. Slumber and sleep.
May your eyes watch over our dreams.
Oo, Draffnir. Slumber and die.
May your eyes watch over our dreams.
```

At the end of the maze, the party discovers the resting place of Draffnir's Skull. They see a large skull at the end of an underground river. The skull has bright white lights in its eye sockets and a cracked broken piece missing from its forehead. Closer inspection will reveal jagged claw marks around the hole and some greenish slimy substance. It's ectoplasm left by Anguisa.

The rhythmic chanting is Greep, a lone goblin in the middle of worshipping the skull in the middle of a circle of animal bones.

### The Boy in the Skull Mask
As the party enters, the white lights of the Skull's eyes will focus on them and the skull-masked boy will appear in front of them, "You finally found me."

The Skull will plead with the party to spare some healing magic. They need to restore at least 50HP to the skull. Any healing magic will work. The party can perform a DC 15 Medicine check to determine the number remaining at any time. Once healed, the Skull will be confused why its defenses are still out of its control. Greep will unleash a fresh cacophony of prayers, and the Skull will realize that its defenses need a reset, which means all sentient creatures need to be removed from the Skull's territory. The Skull will sense the party and Greep nearby, two presences on the outskirts of the foothills (Halden the merchant and Dr Ivans), and two presences in the town (Fig and Neep). All of them will have to be taken out of the area of the illusion, or killed, in order for the Skull's defenses to reset. The Skull doesn't care which.

### Greep
Greep will be friendly towards the party, until they try to convince him to leave. He'll immediately become hostile and throw a rock at the Skull to aggravate it. This will cause the defense systems to acivate, and the skull will shroud Greep in the likeness of a Lich. Every turn, Greep has a 10% chance to transform into a different creature from the following list.

Defeating Greep will dispel the illusion and knock him out on the floor. The party can either kill him right then, or carry him out of the maze. He'll stay knocked out until the party brings him topside. Once he wakes up, he'll want to go back into the hole. The party can either force him to come with them, or mention his brother Neep (again?) to ensure Greep's coorperation.

The party will level up as soon as they leave the monster nest.
