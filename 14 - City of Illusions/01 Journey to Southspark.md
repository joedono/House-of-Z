# Journey to Southspark
There are two main roads from Loftan to Southspark. Both go through Bramhold, then one curves around the lake to the East and the other to the West. The paths are equal in length and difficulty, but feature different possible encounters, as one path leads through the grasslands and the other through a forest.

## Bramhold
A little waystation of a town, completely dwarfed by Loftran. Bramhold is little more than "the other side of Greensburrow". Farmers and traders who couldn't get land within the city, but could still afford to purchase land affected by the confluence of ley lines that makes Loftran so prosperous.

There are a few notable people the party will meet here.

### Maaz and Vorsa
Two grippli traders who just finished delivering a shipment of crab meat to the tavern here in Bramhold. These were the two grippli that were held in the temple about to be sacrificed to Zehir when the players intervened and saved them. The party can reminisce a little and ask about the village. If they ask about the temple excavation, Maaz and Vorsa will say that it was going well, but the diggers encountered something different the deeper they went. Something about the tunnels they were digging was scarier than before. The darkness was darker and threatened to snuff out their torches by itself. The diggers heard horrible noises and fled. They refused to go back and resume the work.

In reality, the Giant Finger Bones are emanating a repelling energy, effectively telling the Grippli "that's far enough. Stay on the surface, where you belong". Whether the party decides to investigate this is up to them, but this particular bone is defending itself and functioning properly.

### Gambling
The party can play devil's dice with a group in the back of the tavern. This is the game where the player rolls 1d6 and the DM rolls 3d6. If nothing matches, the player loses. If the player matches one die the DM rolled, they make back their money and their money again. If the player matches 2 dice, they make back their money and their money x2. If they match 3 dice, they make back their money and their money again x3. If they win too much, the others are likely to stop playing after a round or two.

### More Letters from the Dead
Any party members keeping an ear open for rumors will hear some more people talking about getting letters from relatives they thought were dead.

### Lily Truehart
True to her word, Lily's travels brought her to Bramhold. She had previously met Mori at the ball in the palace of Loftran. She is continuing to sing about the legendary "rat-catchers" but Fran, Ardin, and Ibal will notice that she is embellishing the story considerably, adding things such as bringing rain back to Greensburrow, stopping a rampaging giant, and fighting an army with just the five of them.

## Celestial Comet
After Bramhold, the journey is too far to Southspark to be made in a single day. While the party is camping for the night, whoever is on watch in the middle of the night will see a meteor crash nearby. If they investigate, the party will discover an unconscious Deva (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16840-deva) lying in the crater.

The Deva is a soldier from the Dragon/Celestial war named Hairam. When he wakes up, whether the party nursed him or not, he will be extremely eager to get back to his mission. If he was only healed using basic medicine or has 10 or fewer hit points, he will falter and comment on how he needs more rest before returning to the fray. If he was healed more than that, he will take off immediately into the sky and disappear.

If the party is able to interrogate him, he will evade their questions, saying that his mission doesn't concern "lesser beings such as mortals".

After an hour of rest, Hairam will be well enough to take off into the sky.
