# Monster Foothills
The goal here is to get through the monsters' territory in the foothills and find the entrance to the underground chamber where Draffnir's Skull is.

## Options
The party has several options for getting to the cave, but all roads ultimately lead to going over land with no real advantage. The party will eventually have to fight or sneak their way through the foothills.

## Path Through the Foothills
Without a Ranger, the party will have to make a Survival check to avoid getting lost and running into more bands of monsters.

### Encounter Table
1. Crashed Caravan - A turned-over cart surrounded by bloodstains. The skeletons of the two oxen and the skeletons of the merchants are still here. Long decomposed. Clear signs of a battle. The skeletons can be used by the Skull as a template for a battle

    * The caravan wagons have been picked clean of shiny things and food
    * Roll on the random treasure table if the party finds the hidden lockbox under the wagon floorboards and unlocks it
2. Flickering Battle Site - The site of a major battle in a clearing. Broken down siege weapons, skeletons, and dried blood everywhere. The Skull periodically makes illusions of the combatants and reinacts minor skirmishes as they happened. Party has the chance to take damage from illusions.
3. Ghost Village - A broken village, completely abandoned. The Skull will periodically make illusions of monsters running in and out of the houses and taking food or other valuables. Roll on the random treasure table if the party investigates one of the houses.
4. Minor Raiding Party - A fresh party of Ogres has been created and is being sent out to the front lines. They're on a direct path with the party. They're running and look out for blood. If the party does not attack them, the ogres will run through the party as if they were ghosts, ignoring them.
5. Illusionary Terrain - The foothills in front of the party will give way to a deep crevass. It's illusionary and just covers more foothills.
6. Major Raiding Party
7. Legendary Monster - These monsters do not last long as illusions. They may appear, menace the party for 1d4 turns, then disappear.

8. Legendary Heroes - Halfrek and his party are here again, but their roles are completely random. Some of the party even appears more than once. They will greet the party warmly and converse with them for a time if allowed. Then they will hear the sounds of a monster that the party does not perceive. They will run off to engage it and disappear.

## Patches - Chris Sullivan NPC
Depending on their survival rolls, the party will either encounter Patches randomly in the foothills, or they'll find his cave. Patches is a nearly-insane non-illusory human who has been lost in the foothills for months, barely surviving off of the wilderness, and somehow managing to avoid the patrolling monster bands. Once the party learns how to solve the issue with the Skull, they'll have to locate Patches and bring him out through the monster territory.
