# Monster Foothills
The goal here is to get through the monsters' territory in the foothills and find the entrance to the underground chamber where Draffnir's Skull is.

## Options
The party has several options for getting to the cave, but all roads ultimately lead to going over land with no real advantage. The party will eventually have to fight or sneak their way through the foothills.

## Path Through the Foothills
Without a Ranger, the party will have to make a Survival check to avoid getting lost and running into more bands of monsters.

As they make their way through the foothills, they'll see signs of old battles: long decomposed skeletons, broken down siege weapons, and dried blood trails. If they stick around to loot things, roll on the Random Treasure table https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#RandomTreasure

## Patches
Depending on their survival rolls, the party will either encounter Patches randomly in the foothills, or they'll find his cave. Patches is a nearly-insane non-illusory human who has been lost in the foothills for months, barely surviving off of the wilderness, and somehow managing to avoid the patrolling monster bands. Once the party learns how to solve the issue with the Skull, they'll have to locate Patches and bring him out through the monster territory.
