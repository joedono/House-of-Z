# Monster Foothills
The goal here is to get through the monsters' territory in the foothills and find the entrance to the underground chamber where Draffnir's Skull is.

## Options
The party has several options for getting to the cave.

### By Water
The party could borrow or build a boat and sail around the southern side of the foothills. If they succeed in a Perception check, they might spot a river that goes deeper into the monsters territory. Otherwise, this approach doesn't buy them very much. The human forces have blockaded the water as well as the land, and the monsters have spared no expense with enforcing this side of their defenses.
