# Bring out the Living
-- BOOKMARK --
The party needs to journey out of the monster nest and back through to Southspark in order to gather up Halden, Dr Ivans, Fig, and Neep, and get them out of the area.

After healing the Skull, the illusions will be far less random, but no less dangerous around sentient creatures. The illusions won't attack the party or Greep directly, but they'll have their sights set on the others.

**WARNING:** If the party takes a long rest at any point, it'll change where the NPCs they need to find are.

## Base Camp
The general size of Base Camp has shrunk dramatically, making it much more difficult for the party to find. There were only a handful of "real" dwellings here, since the majority of the army went straight to the front-lines and didn't come back. All the remaining tents are small, camping tents.

### Dr Ivans
The Infirmary tent wasn't real, so Dr Ivans will be grumpy about his building suddenly vanishing around him, along with most of his supplies. The only thing he has that's real is a small pack full of medical supplies. Dr Ivans will remember that the party mentioned another starving person possibly in need of medical attention in Southspark.

### Halden
Halden's cart and tent are real, along with all his food. Halden will be picking through the remains of the other real tents, seeing what he can find. He'll happily follow the party back to Southspark with Dr Ivans and possibly Greep and he'll settle down to take a rest in the Leaky Boulder.

### Long Rest
If the party takes a long rest, Halden and Dr Ivans will be in Southspark. Halden will be in the dining area of the Leady Boulder, and Dr Ivans will be upstairs with Fig.

## Southspark
The town is COMPLETELY abandoned and silent. The only real inhabitants were Fig and Neep. The buildings will look worn down and there'll be shrubs and weeds growing out of the road. The town has been abandoned for months.

### Fig
Fig will be in bed in the second floor of the tavern. Dr Ivans will set about examining him right away. Dr Ivans will immediately ask for "real" food and water to be brought up, mashed together into a smoothie, and fed to Fig slowly. This will save his life. After Fig has digested for a few hours, Dr Ivans will declare that he can be moved, carefully. Halden will offer to put Fig on his cart to get him out of the town and away from the Skull's territory long enough for the illusion to reset.

### Neep
Neep will be hiding in a random building around town.
1. Leaky Boulder
2. Hammer and Nails
3. Sky Delvers
4. Crystal Meltdown

Neep will be actively hiding from the party, as he's got his first breath of freedom and doesn't want to get caught again. If the party has Greep with them, they can have him call out to bring Neep out of hiding. A DC 20 Investigation or Perception check will reveal hints to Neep's location.

#### Important Foreshadowing - Miner Brothers
If the party checks out the Temple of Innovation, they won't find Neep, but they will find a trio of ghosts there that resemble Farley, Marley, and George, the rambuctious miners from the Sky Delvers that Fran fought. They'll approach Ardin, Fran, or Ibal. The miners could perceive them coming into the Sky Delvers guild hall when the illusion was still powered, so they know the trio and are happy to see them again.

The brothers will each approach the party and ask them to deliver letters to their father, Warwick Kelleck (of Warwick GNC) in Loftran. The letters will turn solid once the party receives them. These will be similar letters to what Sorrin, Tabitha, and the party already received from their dead friends.

The three ghosts will then fade out of sight.

### Long Rest
If the party took a long rest, Halden will already be in the dining area of the Leaky Boulder and Dr Ivans will already be upstairs with Fig. He'll declare Fig dead almost as soon as the party arrives, due to acute starvation and dehydration.

Neep will still be in the town, in one of the random buildings above.

## Illusion Reset
After the party gathers up Halden, Dr Ivans, Fig, Neep, and Greep, they can leave and take everyone on the road with them.

Halden and Dr Ivans (and Fig, by extension) will want to head all the way back to Bramhold and spend a night. Dr Ivans will want to bring Fig back to Loftran eventually, but has faith that he'll make a full recovery eventually, assuming he's still alive at this point.

Neep and Greep will want to get away from this area, but they'll part ways with the party when they reach the fork in the road that leads to either Bramhold or Hazelton. They'll eventually settle in Kornith Forest, maybe for Ardin to encounter at some point if he ever goes back home.

When the party is about to cross the threshold of the Skull's territory, the skull-faced boy will appear before them again, without any injuries and with a much less ragged cloak. He'll thank them again for their services. He'll say that he finally feels like he's getting back to his old self again. He'll apologize for causing so much trouble and death, and he hopes that people will settle in Southspark again. His illusions usually serve as enough of a deterrent to keep people out of his cave, but he likes checking in on civilization and people living their lives. He can't see very far, so his only form of entertainment were the people he could see in Southspark.

As a thank-you, the Skull will grant everyone in the party a portion of his power. Everyone present immediately gains access to the Magic Initiate feat, but they can only select spells from the Illusion school of magic. This restricts their choice for Cantrip to Minor Illusion, which Sorrin and Mirv already know, and Color Spray, Disguise Self, Distort Value, Illusory Script, and Silent Image for 1st Level Spells.

If the party hasn't already put it together that the ghost of Anguisa was responsible for the Skull's wound, they can ask the skull-faced boy here and he'll remember that it was a terrifying shade with wings, a long neck, and sharp claws. It reached down and carved out the Skull's forehead, causing all this chaos to happen. The Skull will look up at the sky with worry, and wonder about its siblings. The closest other bone is the Spine on Mount Stratha. The Skull will suggest that the party go to check on it there.

## Next Chapter
The party now has a choice:
* Do they return to Loftran and deliver the letters from the Kelleck brothers to their father, kicking off the King Werewolf quest?
* Do they investigate the status of Draffnir's Spine on Mount Stratha, kicking off the Mountain of the Dead quest?
