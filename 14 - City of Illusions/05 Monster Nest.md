# Monster Nest
The party has arrived at the outskirts of the monster nest. The illusions projected from the Skull here are far more random and dangerous than the illusions projected at the border or in Southspark. The party has to traverse the nest and locate the cave entrance that leads underground to the cave where the Skull is. As the party gets closer, the Skull's semi-automated defense system is going to try even harder to keep them away.

## What Really Happened
The Skull detected the goblins moving in and sent out illusions to drive them away. The goblins joined with the illusionary monsters and started attacking Southspark. The people rallied and went out to destroy the goblins and their new leaders. Normally, the people would have eventually slain the monsters and the goblins and that would have been that, but Anguisa arrived while the first fights were breaking out. Her presence caused a great reaction from the Skull and it conjured up other great monsters to try and drive her away. Being a ghost, Anguisa wasn't affected by this. She dove into the ground, found the Skull, extracted a piece of it, and flew away. With the new injury, and with the constant presence of Greep in the Skull chamber, the Skull feels itself to be constantly in danger and cannot stop producing illusions.

## Topside Appearance
This is where the majority of the fighting in the early days of the war took place, when the first band of goblins settled here and the Skull started generating monsters. The entire fighting population of Southspark is here, dead in the ground and long decomposed. There are decomposing corpses, discarded armor, and broken weapons everywhere. The grass and the trees are all dead, soaked with dried blood. There are no scavangers. There are random illusions cropping up everywhere. The power here is incredibly chaotic.

Along with completely new illusions are reenactment illusions. Illusions that are replaying events that actually happened. This will be when the party gets their first clue on what caused this thing to go so wrong. They'll see replays of the people fighting the monsters, but all the illusions will stop and look at something screaming across the sky. It's Anguisa. She dives straight for the cave entrance. The Skull conjures up another great monster to attempt to drive her away, but she ignores it and flies down through the stone and dirt into the ground.

This doesn't give the party much of a clue as to where the actual cave entrance is, but at least they're in the right place.

## Patches - Chris Sullivan NPC
Depending on their survival rolls, the party will either encounter Patches randomly in the foothills, or they'll find his cave. Patches is a nearly-insane non-illusory human who has been lost in the foothills for months, barely surviving off of the wilderness, and somehow managing to avoid the patrolling monster bands. Once the party learns how to solve the issue with the Skull, they'll have to locate Patches and bring him out through the monster territory.
