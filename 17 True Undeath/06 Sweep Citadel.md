# Sweep's Citadel
There is no obvious way down the cliffside. It is dotted with more caves at intervals between 60ft and 300ft. The party can try to scale down the mountainside and/or try to enter any of the other caves to try and find a better way down. Either way, they'll end up in the citadel of King Sweep, a living goblin and father of Neep and Greep. King Sweep is keeping his forces out of this fight. The dragon terrifies him.

Sweep's citadel is in lockdown mode when the party arrives. They'll encounter no living or unliving thing as they make their way through the citadel and surrounding dwellings, but they'll see signs of fresh activity everywhere. The citadel is obviously inhabitted. If they make any noise or call out, a goblin carpenter named Dent will whisper-yell out to them and coax them into his dwelling, where he'll promptly shut the door and offer them tea. Dent is a cordial goblin with a goblin wife (Leaf) and five kids (Bump, Stump, Grump, Pump, and Thump). The party will be able to get a handle on the state of affairs from Dent if they accept his invitation.

## What Dent Knows
1. The ghost dragon suddenly appeared in King Ashfall's forces a tenday ago. Dent has no idea how Ashfall managed to acquire such an ally.
2. The dragon is turning the tide in the eternal battle between the Crypt Things (the kings, queens, lords, and ladies that fight over this valley). The other armies are losing
3. King Sweep puts the citadel on lockdown whenever the skirmishing gets too "rowdy"
4. Dent expects the fighting to die down around suppertime (in 2-3 hours)
5. Dent does NOT know who is leading the two forces Anguisa and Ashfall are fighting

Dent will advise the party to wait out the lockdown and enjoy some food and drink. Shockingly, the food here is actually palatable.

## State of Sweep
If the party elects to explore the citadel before the lockdown is lifted, they'll only find locked doors and windows.

After the lockdown is lifted, all manner of living "vermin" families come out to resume the day's tasks. Sweep Citadel's population is made up of various "vermin" races such as goblins, kobolds, gremlins, gnolls, kenku, hobgoblins, lizardfolk, and yuan-ti. The general feel of the city is of a larger version of Tabitha's shop, with unstable experiments going on everywhere, from alchemical blunders to imperfect golems. One of the laboratories even got its hands on a C.H.U.M. that it is trying to activate and control.

## Events in Sweep
*use sparingly*

1. C.H.U.M. Activation - The unfortunate goblin who fished the C.H.U.M. out of the River Styx managed to get it working, but it's journey through hell has broken it's controller. It goes haywire, breaking out of the goblin's house and wrecking havoc on the street.
2. Cloning Potion Overload - An alchemical lab finished an experiment brewing a growth potion, meant to make whoever drinks it taller. Instead, it causes the drinker to uncontrollably duplicate themselves. 50+ goblins pour out of the building and onto the street. The clones are blank slates of memories, so fight-or-flight kicks in and they attack anyone in sight. The source goblin can calm them down if someone can nurse him back to consciousness.
3. Disentegrate Laser - An attempt at making a more effective drill goes ballastic when the housing breaks and the laser-drill starts rolling around the street, casting Disentegrate on whatever it is pointed at.
4. Sudden Forest - A farming experiment gets out of hand when a gnoll attempts to show off his new fast-growing fruit tree seed. Fruit trees sprout all up and down the street, effectively casting Bones of the Earth across the entire street.
5. 52 Illusionary Pick-Up - A kenku just purchased what he thinks is a Deck of Many Things. He trips, and a bunch of cards rain out. Creatures start sprouting from the cards, revealing that it was actually a Deck of Illusions.
6. Trash Golem - A soul crystal somehow wound up in the latest batch of junk to be thrown into a pile of trash, resulting in a giant trash golem forming and going wild in the streets.

If the party doesn't take any action to deal with these issues, the higher-level goblin alchemists will arrive and construct their own counter-measure on the spot. It'll be an engineering marvel, but it'll fall apart rather quickly. The lead alchemist goblin will notice the party and scream for them to deal with the crisis while the alchemists fix their contraption.

If the party takes action to deal with any of these issues, they'll attract the attention of the goblin alchemists and be prominently noticed by the populace.

## Blast Noticed
After the fresh crisis, the lead alchemist goblin will approach the party, thanking them for assistance or disparaging them for NOT assisting. This one's name is Blast, and he has the distinction of being the longest-lived alchemist in Sweep Citadel, earning him something of a leadership position. Blast is a potential ally in the party's quest against Anguisa. His experimental weapons can provide artillery and (most importantly) a mostly-functioning airship. The party should be VERY interested in acquiring an airship.

There's just one problem. Blast needs a stronger material for the housing on the boiler. In order to get the air in the airship balloon hot enough to rise through the hotter-than-average air on Thanatos, Blast needs a material stronger than steal and VERY heat resistant. Blast doesn't know where such a material can be found, but all sorts of discarded things wind up in Thanatos. Blast is confident that the party can find something if they keep their eyes out. The party will eventually be able to find the material Blast requires making up the boiler of The Shadow, the ship in The Frozen Sea where Zeethrae and her band live.

If the party wants to speak to King Sweep, Blast is able to arrange that.

Blast recognizes Tabitha's Bag of Sending and asks after her, expressing regret that he became trapped on this plane several months ago and hasn't been in touch. He'll mention another party of adventurers with a similar bag were seen wandering the Burning Wastes a few tendays ago. He expects they're long gone by now. This will be the adventuring band that forgot they had a Bag of Sending and were sending all their junk into Tabitha's acid cauldron. If Gail is still with the party, he'll be shy about admitting who he is, but Blast will recognize him.

## King of the Trash Heep
King Sweep is super paranoid about the next skirmish, despite assurances from his staff that it's not likely to take place for another 8-10 hours. He won't be interested in talking to the party unless they make it known that their objective is to get rid of the dragon.

### What Sweep Knows
1. If the party mentions his sons, Neep or Greep, he'll instantly warm up to the party and ask about Neep mostly. He sees Greep as a terrible disappointment who will never amount to anything. Greep is the one who took control of Draffnir's Skull and was responsible for the City of Illusions.
2. That the battle today was between Ashfall, Howlfish, and Eloreth. The dragon is helping Ashfall.
3. King Howlfish is undead and appreciates a good joke
4. Queen Eloreth is living and is desperately trying to find someone who knows Planeshift to send her home to Loftran on the Material Plane
5. King Ashfall is undead and is one of the many kings here who desires to overthrow Orcus and become lord of Thanatos
6. King Ashfall will have control over the Valley in only a couple days if the dragon continues to support him
7. Sweep has no idea who the dragon is or what she wants
8. Sweep is quite content being a king and isn't interested in leaving
9. King Ensar is the figurehead monarch of the City of Liches and has come the closest to overthrowing Orcus

## What Now?
The party has a couple threads to followup on.
1. Search for a heat-resistant material for Blast to make them an airship. Found on the Frozen Sea when they find The Shadow.
2. Talk to Queen Eloreth and find her someone who knows Planeshift. Jasper and Valmar can learn this after one more level up.
3. Participate in the fighting with the goal of terminating Anguisa, or at least removing her support from King Ashfall and denying her an ally
4. Journey to the City of Liches to speak to King Ensar
