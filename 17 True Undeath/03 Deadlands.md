# The Deadlands
A massive (mostly symbolic) graveyard. There are billions of gravestones here, one for every soul lost to the Abyss after death. There isn't any danger of the denizens of the graves attacking the party in the form of ghosts or zombies, but the keepers of the graveyard don't like trespassers. The wind over the graveyard carries the sound of laughter.

## Grave Tenders
The Deadlands are tended to by [Chasme](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17140-chasme) and their pet [Barlguras](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17110-barlgura). Each Chasme usually has 2-3 Barlguras that serve as enforcers and heavy labor. They'll watch the party from afar, hiding among the graves. They might try to ambush the party while they sleep, but the Tiny Hut will prevent that. They'll stalk the party through the Deadlands, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

While the Chasmes and Barlguras are able to handle most of the tending, a large number of [Cacklers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/175285-cackler) also tend to the graves. The party encounters these as if they are wildlife. They scatter at the sight of the party, but may stick their nose out if a fight breaks out between the party and the tenders.

The party is able to avoid angering the grave tenders by promising their soul to the cemetary after they die. The contract is sealed by giving the Chasme something a possession that uniquely belongs to each party-member. As the Chasme have no knowledge of the party and little magical detection abilities, the party might be able to convince them that something extremely commonplace is actually unique, such as a single gold coin or a field ration, which would invalidate the agreement, but not alert the Chasmes.

## Sinkholes
Thousands of graves and graves-upon-graves have made the footing here EXTREMELY unstable. The party is very likely to discover a sinkhole or pit trap during their travel through the cemetary. If two or more of the party fall into the sinkholes, the Grave Tenders will choose that time to strike or negotiate.

The sinkholes are also hazardous during battle. Any time a player moves, roll a d20. On a 15 or more, the player must roll a DC 15 Dex Save or fall prone into a 5ft deep hole.
