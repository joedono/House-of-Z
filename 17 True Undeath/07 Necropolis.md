# Necropolis
The party has arrived in the main "city" of the Valley of the Crypt Things. The area is the ruins of a vast city, and is under constant war between the Crypt Things. The current major players are:
1. King Ashfall
   1. His soldiers wear purple
   2. He is allied with Anguisa
   3. Undead
   4. Originally a king from another continent. Not Draffnir
2. King Howlfish
   1. His soldiers wear orange
   2. Nearly fully conquered after the last skirmish
   3. Undead
   4. Originally a king of a civilation from the distant past, based in the Laughing Mountains on Draffnir
   5. Likes a good joke
3. Queen Eloreth
   1. Her soldiers wear yellow
   2. Living
   3. Desperate to find someone who knows Planeshift to send her back to the material plane

The party's goal here is to make contact with Queen Eloreth and possibly halt or delay Anguisa's efforts to build King Ashfall up enough that he'll help her assault the Orcusgate.

## Current Situation
King Howlfish lost the majority of his forced in the skirmish earlier today. His territory has largely been taken over by Ashfall. Eloreth is attempting to formulate a plan to re-take Howlfish's territory, but not so much that he musters his forced against her. The undead monarchs in the Valley can't think straight, being undead. They'll attack whoever they recall as doing the most damage to them the most recently. If Eloreth pushes too far into Howlfish's territory, even if she intends to give the territory back, Howlfish will turn on her. Between that and Ashfall, Eloreth won't survive.

Skeletons and demons patrol the necropolis, getting into minor skirmishes while their monarchs muster their forces and plan offensives.

Anguisa has brought with her a means to reconstitute the skeletal soldiers. She has Ashfall send out demons loyal to him to collect the skulls of fallen soldiers. She performs a ritual that restores their bodies and makes them loyal to her. This is how she has been able to give Ashfall the advantage and bring him close to conquering the Valley. He's already conquered the territory of most of the other monarchs. Only Howlfish and Eloreth stand in his way now, and Howlfish is nearly spent.

## Monsters
The party is likely to run into patrols of these creatures as they navigate the necropolis.
