# Necropolis
The party has arrived in the main "city" of the Valley of the Crypt Things. The area is the ruins of a vast city, and is under constant war between the Crypt Things. The current major players are:
1. King Ashfall
   1. His soldiers wear purple
   2. He is allied with Anguisa
   3. Undead
   4. Originally a king from another continent. Not Draffnir
2. King Howlfish
   1. His soldiers wear orange
   2. Nearly fully conquered after the last skirmish
   3. Undead
   4. Originally a king of a civilation from the distant past, based in the Laughing Mountains on Draffnir
   5. Likes a good joke
3. Queen Eloreth
   1. Her soldiers wear yellow
   2. Living
   3. Desperate to find someone who knows Planeshift to send her back to the material plane

The party's goal here is to make contact with Queen Eloreth and possibly halt or delay Anguisa's efforts to build King Ashfall up enough that he'll help her assault the Orcusgate.

The territories in the Valley are divided by walls made out of the rubble. The walls are constantly torn down and rebuilt as territory is conquered. There are currently 5 territories divided by walls: Ashfall, Eloreth, Howlfish, and two monarchs who have lost all their territory and have retreated to wait for an opportunity to obtain more undead soldiers.

## Current Situation
King Howlfish lost the majority of his forced in the skirmish earlier today. His territory has largely been taken over by Ashfall. Eloreth is attempting to formulate a plan to re-take Howlfish's territory, but not so much that he musters his forced against her. The undead monarchs in the Valley can't think straight, being undead. They'll attack whoever they recall as doing the most damage to them the most recently. If Eloreth pushes too far into Howlfish's territory, even if she intends to give the territory back, Howlfish will turn on her. Between that and Ashfall, Eloreth won't survive.

Skeletons and demons patrol the necropolis, getting into minor skirmishes while their monarchs muster their forces and plan offensives.

Anguisa has brought with her a means to reconstitute the skeletal soldiers. She has Ashfall send out demons loyal to him to collect the skulls of fallen soldiers. She performs a ritual that restores their bodies and makes them loyal to her. This is how she has been able to give Ashfall the advantage and bring him close to conquering the Valley. He's already conquered the territory of most of the other monarchs. Only Howlfish and Eloreth stand in his way now, and Howlfish is nearly spent.

## Monsters
The party is likely to run into patrols of these creatures as they navigate the necropolis.

## Events

### Skirmish
Party happens upon a fight between Eloreth and Ashfall forces. Ashfall sent a squadron of skeletons and barlguras. Eloreth sent her own squadron of skeletons, giant skeletons, and a Glabrezu she employs. The speaks Abyssal and Telepathy and can be convinced to bring the party back to Queen Eloreth if they present themselves as useful. However, it won't trust the party at all and without sufficient threat, will attempt to lead the party into traps or other ambushes.

The glabrezu's name is Ergrath.

### Anguisa Patrol
Anguisa does a flyby. She's not really looking for anything. Her objective is to inspire dread in Eloreth's living forces. She might still discover the party, however.

### Pitfall
A section of street gives way under the party. DC 18 Dex Save to avoid falling. The pit is 30ft deep. PCs take 3d10 bludgeoning damage if they fall in.

### Benni Bloodhammer
The party discovers a dwarf flitting around the ruins. Gail will recognize the dwarf as Benni Bloodhammer, one of his adventuring companions that he lost in the Labyrinth. Benni has lost his mind and behaves as if under the Feeblemind spell. If pursued, Benni will flee through the ruins back to his hidey-hole, the inside of what was once a forge in what was once a smithy. Gail will try to talk him down and get him to join the group.

### Avalanche Trap
A wire is rigged to a loose stone in a pile of rubble across the street. If triggered, large stones will fall off of the buildings on either side of the street and crush creatures caught in the avalanche.

### Prisoners of War
The party discovers a large group of skeletons chained up and hanging from a wall. The skeletons all turn their skulls and watch as the party approaches. If the party gets closer, the skeletons start making a hissing noise, as if exhaling slowly. One of them will eventually manage to form the words "Help Us".

These skeletons belonged to a monarch who hasn't regained their power in hundreds of years. They've been hanging here neglected for all that time and have had the "good" fortune to remain undiscovered by the current active forces.

They are not hostile to the party, even if the party leaves them. If the party releases them, however, they will be friendly to the party and will follow their orders, accepting whoever in the party gives the strongest first impression as their new monarch.

### Ancient Castle
May once have been the ruling citadel for this city, now it's a hollow monument to the passage of time. The Crypt Things sometimes compete for control over this place, but something far darker and more evil makes its home here.

The portions of the castle visible from above ground include a partially intact second floor with only piles of rubble as the obvious way to ascend. There are remnents of intact rooms and stubs of walls. A decent investigation of the area will reveal a downward staircase that leads to the crypts below, where the Balor makes its home.

This could turn into a dungeon crawl if the party wants to venture in. The castle crypt connects to the city sewer system and might offer an easier route to the Eloreth territory.

### Wall
The party encounters an intact wall that stretches for blocks in both directions. If they attempt to scale it, they can reach the top without much trouble, but it will put them out in the open for an Anguisa Patrol. They could attempt to break it, but it is pretty sturdy. If they venture far enough along either length of the wall, they'll find a short tunnel with an open gate at one end and a closed gate at the opposite end, along with a lever. There is rubble piled up against the left wall too. The closed gate is not trapped, but the lever has a wire that will drop the open gate and drop a number of metal bars as an alarm.

If the party does not escape soon, skeletons without allegience colors will rush their position. The skeletons won't have the intelligence to open the gates and will uselessly paw at the players through them. However, it'll only be a matter of time before the noise draws something more intelligent that will attempt to take the party prisoner to bring before Eloreth. This might be the party's chance to get to Eloreth without other trouble.

Options for escape:
* The party could attempt to lift one of the gates open. DC 25 Athletics check
* A DC 18 Investigation check will reveal that the rubble against the left wall covers a secondary tunnel that leads to a staircase. The staircase leads up to the top of the wall, once again potentially exposing the party to an Anguisa Patrol.

## Eloreth
Eloreth's HQ is in a south-western section of the valley. The party will have a hard time gaining access to her, as all of the creatures here exist for two purposes: to fight soldiers from other monarchs, and to make more undead to add to their own monarch's ranks. Thus, if the party shows any signs of weakness or arrives without an escort, they'll be harassed and thrown into fights at every turn.

If the party is captured alive, they'll be thrown into a dungeon to await the reraising ritual.

Queen Eloreth has added a third order to the purpose of her consorts: bring her any living magic users. Therefore, if any of the party demonstrates substantial magical ability, all fighting will cease and the party will be brought before the queen.

Eloreth will make a show out of bringing the party in for a private audience. She'll have trouble getting her undead retinue to leave her alone with her guests, but she'll manage it. Once alone, Eloreth will ask who in the party knows magic, and then break down and beg them to send her home. Since none of the party knows Planeshift, they can't really help her yet. Valmar will be able to learn it with one level up, which the party can get either after participating in the Battle for the Valley.

Since they can't help her leave, the party will have a choice. Queen Eloreth doesn't believe she will last the night without help. Her forces are being decimated by Anguisa and she's losing numbers left and right. She doesn't particularly care about the fighting, but she can't leave on her own without being potentially caught and slaughtered. The party could potentially be her escort out of the valley, but that would leave Anguisa with an unopposed ally in King Ashfall. She'd accomplish her goal and leave to go to the City of Liches to get information out of King Ensar.

It'd be in the party's and Queen Eloreth's best interests if they could deal a decisive blow to King Ashfall's forces before leaving. If they could re-balance the battle for power in the Valley, Anguisa would have to spend weeks re-building King Ashfall's (or someone else's) forces to a point where they'd be stable enough to aid her in a future battle with Orcus' forces.

The obvious course of action would be for the party to take out Anguisa here and now, but she's not only extremely powerful, but she's aided by an army of the undead. Queen Eloreth will propose an alternate solution. The ritual for reanimating skeletons is rather specialized and requires an elaborate setup that is expensive and not easily replaced. All the monarchs know how to set up the ritual, so Queen Eloreth can show the party her's so they know what to look for. If the party can destroy King Ashfall's ritual site, it'll disrupt his ability to replenish his skeleton ranks and the tide of the battles will shift towards other monarchs, even if Eloreth herself isn't present to lead her own forces.

The monarch doesn't need to be present to enact the ritual, they're just the only ones who know how to set up the site.

Of course, the ritual site will be in Ashfall HQ and heavily guarded, which means DUNGEON CRAWL!!
