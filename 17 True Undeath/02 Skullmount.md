# Skullmount
A 4,000ft tall pile/mountain of bones. The various creatures who's bones are here still have wills of their own and attempt to reform into their proper skeletons. The overriding will is Retaw, Draffnir's brother and one of the primary creators of humans. His will mixes with the will of the various other creatures here and causes the bones to come together in haphazard creations.

## Malformed Skeletons
If the party attempts to scale the mountain, treat this more as a skill challenge than a battle. Maybe ALL of the bones are constantly moving, making this a challenge similar to trying to climb a quicksand mountain. The party could try to sail up the mountain, navigating the "currents" of bones as they snake their way this way and that. They have to destroy any skeletons that form into something coherent and dangerous, like a shark or a gorilla. Treat any dangerous malformed creatures as minions.

If the party falls into the current, have them take a ton of bludgeoning damage and be spit out at the bottom of the mountain.

## Caleb
The asshole prison guard turned murderous Yuan-Ti has one more cameo to make in this campaign. He won't pose much of a threat to the party, but he'll try to heckle them one last time before they either obliterate him or just sail past him.

## Retaw
The intact skull of Draffnir's brother sits at the peak of Skullmount, giving it its name. Retaw's essence is also exerting the same desire to reform himself as the rest of the bones of Skullmount, but he's having just as little luck as the rest of the creatures. The skull, being intact, is still capable of lucid communication.

Retaw treats the party as though they are lost children visiting their failure of a father. He'll be happy to see them but ashamed that they have to see him in such a state. Meeting Retaw will be the first time the party has a chance to hear the true story of the creation of the world, as well as the current state of affairs of the Dragons and Celestials, possibly providing the final piece to the puzzle about what Anguisa has been trying to do.

Retaw will be able to completely explain the purpose of Anguisa's list and what she needs from Thanatos, the Wand of Orcus. He is also the source of the letters from the dead that people on the Material Plane have been receiving.

Unfortunately, the party won't be able to do anything to help Retaw out of his predicament. Trying to help Retaw will be the same effort as emptying the ocean with a teacup.
