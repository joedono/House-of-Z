# Maze of the Crypt Things
The party is likely to catch up to Anguisa here. She is currently embroiled in attempting to bolster one of the undead kings that rules over this valley with enough demonic allies and tactical advice to cement him in a position of semi-permanent influence and control over territory. She's doing this to acquire the king's allegience in her quest to steal the Wand of Orcus or defeat a powerful demon.

This will be the party's first actual fight with Ghost Anguisa.

The valley itself is a twisting valley with branches between two major mountains. The rocky walls of the valley are dotted with alcoves and caves big enough to hold citadels similar to Moria. Each citadel bears the insignias of one long-forgotten kingdom or another, twisted by time spent on this plane. The worked stone here is very well-kept by [Goristros](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17156-goristro) on loan from The Endless Maze. They stay out of the fighting, but work to make the cave system ever more elaborate. Baphomet's way of passing time, messing with Orcus, and gradually asserting his plane over Thanatos. The more lucid denizens of the Valley are constantly having their plans ruined by new walls or open pathways made by the minotaurs.

## Finding the Valley
The Burning Waste and the mountains that surround the valley make up a trecherous labyrinth that eventually connects to The Endless Maze, the layer of the Abyss ruled over by Baphomet. Getting through the maze is a horrible ordeal. Use some portions of *The Maze* setting book to fill this in with appropriate hazards.

## The Fight is Underway
As the party nears the end of the maze section and gets to the valley itself, they'll hear the sounds of a distant battle. The sounds will eventually lead them to a cave exit on a high mountain, where they can look down and see a battle in progress on the valley floor and partway up one wall. Most noticible will be Anguisa, her dark form flying into the floor and back out again as she rends line after line of skeletal warriors and demons. If the party looks closely and makes an INT check, they can notice basic war tactics being played out and separate out the two forces Anguisa appears to be attacking and the one force she appears to be helping.

The battle is between three armies:
1. King Howlfish - a long-dead king of a forgotten civilization in the Laughing Mountains.
2. Queen Eloreth - a previous monarch of Eloreth and a lady of Loftran. One of the family to go through the portal in the secret room. Some of her number bear the insignia the party will recognize, although not from this distance.
3. King Ashfall - a king from a different continent. Anguisa is helping this army make its stand against the other two.
