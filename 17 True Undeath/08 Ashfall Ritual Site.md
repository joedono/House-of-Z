# Ashfall Ritual Site
The party has discovered that Queen Eloreth will likely not survive the war in the Valley of the Crypt Things for much longer, and that Anguisa's hold over territory and her allyship with King Ashfall will be complete unless the tide is turned in the war.

Since outright defeat of King Ashfall or Anguisa is likely beyond the party's capabilities at this point, Queen Eloreth has proposed a plan to disrupt Ashfall's method of resupplying his army: locate and destroy the ritual site that Ashfall uses to reconstitute the skeletal soldiers. The time it takes to get the site back up and running will be more than enough for Queen Eloreth's forces to regain a substantial amount of territory and soldiers to restore balance to the Valley. This will effectively reset Anguisa's plan to gain an ally here, and buy the party enough time to help Queen Eloreth escape.

Eloreth has placed her own site underneath her HQ. She reasons that Ashfall has done the same. The party already knows where Ashfall's HQ is. The problem is getting there, and then navigating the labyrinth underneath it.

## Journey to Ashfall Base
Eloreth will educate the party on the disused sewer system that runs under the Valley, giving the players the choice between an overland route or an underground route.

### Overland Route
The overland route is constantly patrolled by both Eloreth and Ashfall forces. While Eloreth can provide the party with colored banners to ensure that they aren't attacked by her own forces, flying any colors will mean Ashfall's soldiers will attack them on sight. Not to mention Anguisa patrols the overland route every so often.

#### Events
The events the party may run into while hiking through the Valley to get to Ashfall's Base

##### Friendly Patrol
A squadron of skeletons wearing Eloreth's colors are returning from a successful skirmish. The squadron includes a couple regular skeletons, one giant skeleton, the body of a dead Glabrezu, and the Glabrezu that Gail had imprisoned during the party's journey here. That Glabrezu, Ergrath, will recognize the party, but any hostility he has will vanish if he sees them wearing Eloreth colors. Ergrath was severely wounded when the Forcecage spell ran out in the middle of another skirmish and he was taken by surprise by Ashfall forces. Ergrath will be able to give the party advice on their overland route so as to avoid at least the Ashfall patrols and numerous traps laid throughout the city.

##### Unfriendly Patrol
The party encounters another squadron of Ashfall soldiers. 5 skeleton archers riding on the backs of armanites this time, along with two trailing Barlgura to pick up the remains.

##### Anguisa Patrol
The Ghost of Anguisa is doing a flyby. The party will have to hide in a ruined house to avoid her gaze.

##### Ruined Howlfish Patrol
A squadron of skeletal beasts and dinosaurs are wandering. They are clad in the color purple, signaling that they are from Howlfish's forces. These beasts are without direction and will attack indiscriminately. They are all that's left of Howlfish's effective forces.

### Sewer Route
The underground route doesn't have any soldiers from either side, but it is home to subterranean demons, occasionally butts up against the Endless Maze plane of the Abyss, and all routes through the sewer eventually pass through the territory of something so big and bad that even the skeletal soldiers instinctually avoid it. That big bad is the Balor that lives under the Ancient Castle.

#### Events
The events the party may run into while navigating the sewers under the Valley

##### Balor and Minions
The sewer route has many paths that intersect with direct lines to the Ancient Castle, where the Balor lives. The party may run into the Balor with its minions as it's out patrolling its territory

##### Soul Wind
The myriad skeletons and undead that used to populate the Valley still have a slight attachment to the land. The ghosts of these creatures manifest beneath the necropolis in the form of a deadly wind that sweeps through the sewers and catacombs beneath. The wind blows in straight lines as best it can, so ducking into a corridor or hiding behind debris or a shield will prevent the effects.

A creature exposed to the Soul Wind must make a DC 17 CON save. On a failure, they take 4d6 necrotic damage and gain 1 level of exhaustion. On a success, they take half the damage and gain no exhaustion.

##### Oozes
Oozes coat many of the still waters in the sewer. The party could be ambused at any time.

##### Power Station
The magically charged station that once powered the city is long-dormant. The metal has rusted to the point of being entirely useless. An arcana check might reveal that this station could generate enough electricity to power the entire plane.

Despite it's disuse, there are still 3 power rods sitting on the rack, ready to be put into place while the other rods are taken out to recharge. Each rod functions as a Javelin of Lightning. https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4667-javelin-of-lightning

Hanging around in this room for too long will awaken the 5 Steam Mephits hiding inside the furnace: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17022-steam-mephit

##### Spider Lair
Two Phase Spiders make their nest here, along with many babies:

##### Dwelling
Nobody lives down here anymore, but this might provide a moment of respite for the party. Investigating the beds reveals the scraps of a backpack under one of them with 15gp and three potions of Superior Healing.

##### Crypt
Three former monarchs of the Valley of the Crypt Things are entombed down here after falling from power centuries ago. They can be heard gently scratching at the interior of their coffins. If released, they will shamble to the surface and eventually make an attempt to regain power and conquer territory.

They aren't lucid enough to acknowledge the party or give them any information.
