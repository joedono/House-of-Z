# Ashfall Ritual Site
The party has discovered that Queen Eloreth will likely not survive the war in the Valley of the Crypt Things for much longer, and that Anguisa's hold over territory and her allyship with King Ashfall will be complete unless the tide is turned in the war.

Since outright defeat of King Ashfall or Anguisa is likely beyond the party's capabilities at this point, Queen Eloreth has proposed a plan to disrupt Ashfall's method of resupplying his army: locate and destroy the ritual site that Ashfall uses to reconstitute the skeletal soldiers. The time it takes to get the site back up and running will be more than enough for Queen Eloreth's forces to regain a substantial amount of territory and soldiers to restore balance to the Valley. This will effectively reset Anguisa's plan to gain an ally here, and buy the party enough time to help Queen Eloreth escape.

Eloreth has placed her own site underneath her HQ. She reasons that Ashfall has done the same. The party already knows where Ashfall's HQ is. The problem is getting there, and then navigating the labyrinth underneath it.

## Journey to Ashfall Base
Eloreth will educate the party on the disused sewer system that runs under the Valley, giving the players the choice between an overland route or an underground route.


## Overland Route
The overland route is constantly patrolled by both Eloreth and Ashfall forces. While Eloreth can provide the party with colored banners to ensure that they aren't attacked by her own forces, flying any colors will mean Ashfall's soldiers will attack them on sight. Not to mention Anguisa patrols the overland route every so often.

### Events
The events the party may run into while hiking through the Valley to get to Ashfall's Base

#### Friendly Patrol
A squadron of skeletons wearing Eloreth's colors are returning from a successful skirmish. The squadron includes a couple regular skeletons, one giant skeleton, the body of a dead Glabrezu, and the Glabrezu that Gail had imprisoned during the party's journey here. That Glabrezu, Ergrath, will recognize the party, but any hostility he has will vanish if he sees them wearing Eloreth colors. Ergrath was severely wounded when the Forcecage spell ran out in the middle of another skirmish and he was taken by surprise by Ashfall forces. Ergrath will be able to give the party advice on their overland route so as to avoid at least the Ashfall patrols and numerous traps laid throughout the city.

#### Unfriendly Patrol
The party encounters another squadron of Ashfall soldiers. 5 skeleton archers riding on the backs of armanites this time, along with two trailing Barlgura to pick up the remains.

#### Anguisa Patrol
The Ghost of Anguisa is doing a flyby. The party will have to hide in a ruined house to avoid her gaze.

#### Ruined Howlfish Patrol
A squadron of skeletal beasts and dinosaurs are wandering. They are clad in the color purple, signaling that they are from Howlfish's forces. These beasts are without direction and will attack indiscriminately. They are all that's left of Howlfish's effective forces.

## Sewer Route
The underground route doesn't have any soldiers from either side, but it is home to subterranean demons, occasionally butts up against the Endless Maze plane of the Abyss, and all routes through the sewer eventually pass through the territory of something so big and bad that even the skeletal soldiers instinctually avoid it. That big bad is the Balor that lives under the Ancient Castle.

### Events
The events the party may run into while navigating the sewers under the Valley

#### Balor and Minions
The sewer route has many paths that intersect with direct lines to the Ancient Castle, where the Balor lives. The party may run into the Balor with its minions as it's out patrolling its territory

Minions

#### Soul Wind
The myriad skeletons and undead that used to populate the Valley still have a slight attachment to the land. The ghosts of these creatures manifest beneath the necropolis in the form of a deadly wind that sweeps through the sewers and catacombs beneath. The wind blows in straight lines as best it can, so ducking into a corridor or hiding behind debris or a shield will prevent the effects.

A creature exposed to the Soul Wind must make a DC 17 CON save. On a failure, they take 4d6 necrotic damage and gain 1 level of exhaustion. On a success, they take half the damage and gain no exhaustion.

#### Oozes
Oozes coat many of the still waters in the sewer. The party could be ambused at any time.

#### Power Station
The magically charged station that once powered the city is long-dormant. The metal has rusted to the point of being entirely useless. An arcana check might reveal that this station could generate enough electricity to power the entire plane.

Despite it's disuse, there are still 3 power rods sitting on the rack, ready to be put into place while the other rods are taken out to recharge. Each rod functions as a Javelin of Lightning. https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4667-javelin-of-lightning

Hanging around in this room for too long will awaken the 5 Steam Mephits hiding inside the furnace: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17022-steam-mephit

#### Spider Lair
Two Phase Spiders make their nest here, along with many babies:

#### Dwelling
Nobody lives down here anymore, but this might provide a moment of respite for the party. Investigating the beds reveals the scraps of a backpack under one of them with 15gp and three potions of Superior Healing.

#### Crypt
Three former monarchs of the Valley of the Crypt Things are entombed down here after falling from power centuries ago. They can be heard gently scratching at the interior of their coffins. If released, they will shamble to the surface and eventually make an attempt to regain power and conquer territory.

They aren't lucid enough to acknowledge the party or give them any information.

#### Umber Hulk Colony

## Ashfall Base
The sewers butt right up against the dug out underground beneath Ashfall's base, allowing semi-easy access to the basement and the ritual site. The basement area has 8 rooms, most of which are leftovers from previous monarchs and not used. A line of skeletons leads from the Ritual Chamber out the exit to the upper floors of the base.

### The King that Was Throne Room
Lower left room

Throne room of a former monarch who preferred even darker light than the perpetual overcast of the Abyss. The north and south walls are lined with coffin-like boxes. Soft scratching noises can be heard coming from each one. The throne is falling apart, barely recognizable as a chair anymore. A skeletal king sits motionless in the throne.

The king has a Staff of Power lying across his lap. Of course, approaching the king will awaken him and his skeletal subordinates from their coffins.

### Mushroom Bog
Lower middle/left room

The mushrooms are fed from the brackish water of the sewers, and constantly puff out spores. The effect on the room is identical to a DC 18 Cloudkill spell. A gust of wind will temporarily dissipate the cloud, but it will be quickly refilled by the mushrooms. The spores do damage even if the target holds their breath.

Skeletons are immune to poison damage, so the line of skeletons coming out of the Ritual Chamber and passing through this room are unaffected by the cloud of spores.

### Servant's Camp
Lower right room

Boxes here contain the skeletal remains of the King That Was's servants and vassals. Several freshly reconstituted skeletons from the Ritual Chamber have gotten lost and wandered in here. They wander aimlessly, occasionally bumping into the boxes and hissing at the walls. With zero direction, they won't even retaliate if attacked. They'll respond to the first authority figure who presents themselves, including the party. Making any sort of CHA check against the skeletons automatically succeeds and they'll accept the first person who gives them orders (or even just basic information) as their new leader.

### Primary Egg Nest
Lower middle/right room

Former nest of the Phase Spiders before Ashfall's troops cleared them out. Little to be found here other than the remains of nests and broken egg sacks.

### Storage
Upper left room

This room is full of piles of miscellaneous bones. The barlgura use the bones from this room to assemble skeletons. This is the reason they only have to retrieve skulls from the field of battle. In piles this big, the bones have a bit of pull on their souls, similar to Skullmount. The piles shift and half-formed arms occasionally reach out to grasp at things.

### Secondary Egg Nest
Upper middle/left room

Second former nest of the Phase Spiders before they were cleared out. Two intact eggs remain here that will hatch into swarms of spiders if disturbed.

### Ritual Chamber
Upper middle room

This is the main site of Ashfall's army reconstitution. Two Barlguras guard in here, with a third sorting through a newly brought bag of skulls. The pit in the image is actually a ritual circle drawn on the floor and can be walked on. The mimic-looking thing in the lower-right corner of the room is the wire lattice the party is supposed to destory. It has 12 AC, 30 HP, and is immune to lightning, poison, psychic, necrotic, and radient damage.

Doing lightning damage to the lattice will cause the next skeleton that is reconstituted to be super-charged. It'll have the stats of a regular skeleton, but will have 100 hp, be immune to lightning damage, and will cast Call Lightning (DC 16) centered on itself every turn.

### Cages
Upper middle/right room

Empty broken cages. Nothing else of note here.


## Escape
Damaging the lattice will, of course, set off an alarm. Barlgura and Armanite will start descending into the basement and try to cut the players off. The skeletons will do nothing. The party will (hopefully) attempt to escape through the sewers again. All they really have to do is escape past the Balor. The alarm will draw its anger as well and it will investigate with its minions. Once the other demons hear its roar, they'll back off and the players will be able to escape.

If the party winds up in a fight with the Balor, it will demand in Abyssal, who woke it up. The party can make a DC 15 Deception check to convince it that the demons chasing them did it.

## Return and Reward
The party successfully dismantled Ashfall's ritual site without alerting Anguisa. Ashfall has been set on the long road to the bottom. Eloreth's forces will continue to bolster themselves using her ritual site. Eloreth won't be able to leave her base openly, but that won't stop the party from sending her back to the Material Plane from her basement.

There's only one problem though. If the party goes into Eloreth's private chambers, then exits without her, they might be interrogated. The demons are rather dumb, but could quickly discover the ruse. Eloreth will bring this up as a concern, but not really have any idea how to solve it.

If the party doesn't have a plan, Gail will volunteer himself. He knows the Mask of Many Faces and is confident he can pull off a convincing Eloreth for long enough to figure out an escape.

With the main errand done, Eloreth will make a show of dismissing her "hired mercenaries" and explain to the party how to get out of the Valley and go North.

She'll also mention King Howlfish's base to the party. Being situated in the northern section of the Valley, Howlfish would sponsor expeditions out into Thanatos. His forces weren't worth much in terms of strength or intelligence, but apparently one among his army was a native to a sand-swept land at one time and remembered how to make sand skiffs. If the party searches around the northern Valley, they might be able to find one they can use to get across the open land to the north of the valley and travel quickly to the City of Liches.

If the party decides to take this chance, they'll run into a Ruined Howlfish Patrol.
