# Ashfall Ritual Site
The party has discovered that Queen Eloreth will likely not survive the war in the Valley of the Crypt Things for much longer, and that Anguisa's hold over territory and her allyship with King Ashfall will be complete unless the tide is turned in the war.

Since outright defeat of King Ashfall or Anguisa is likely beyond the party's capabilities at this point, Queen Eloreth has proposed a plan to disrupt Ashfall's method of resupplying his army: locate and destroy the ritual site that Ashfall uses to reconstitute the skeletal soldiers. The time it takes to get the site back up and running will be more than enough for Queen Eloreth's forces to regain a substantial amount of territory and soldiers to restore balance to the Valley. This will effectively reset Anguisa's plan to gain an ally here, and buy the party enough time to help Queen Eloreth escape.

Eloreth has placed her own site underneath her HQ. She reasons that Ashfall has done the same. The party already knows where Ashfall's HQ is. The problem is getting there, and then navigating the labyrinth underneath it.

## Journey to Ashfall Base
Eloreth will educate the party on the disused sewer system that runs under the Valley, giving the players the choice between an overland route or an underground route.

### Overland Route
The overland route is constantly patrolled by both Eloreth and Ashfall forces. While Eloreth can provide the party with colored banners to ensure that they aren't attacked by her own forces, flying any colors will mean Ashfall's soldiers will attack them on sight. Not to mention Anguisa patrols the overland route every so often.

##### Unfriendly Skeletal Patrol
##### Anguisa Patrol
##### Ruined Howlfish Patrol

### Sewer Route
The underground route doesn't have any soldiers from either side, but it is home to subterranean demons, occasionally butts up against the Endless Maze plane of the Abyss, and all routes through the sewer eventually pass through the territory of something so big and bad that even the skeletal soldiers instinctually avoid it. That big bad is the Balor that lives under the Ancient Castle.

##### Balor and Minions
The sewer route has many paths that intersect with direct lines to the Ancient Castle, where the Balor lives. The party may run into the Balor with its minions as it's out patrolling its territory

##### Soul Wind
The myriad skeletons and undead that used to populate the Valley still have a slight attachment to the land. The ghosts of these creatures manifest beneath the necropolis in the form of a deadly wind that sweeps through the sewers and catacombs beneath. The wind blows in straight lines as best it can, so ducking into a corridor or hiding behind debris or a shield will prevent the effects.

A creature exposed to the Soul Wind must make a DC 17 CON save. On a failure, they take 4d6 necrotic damage and gain 1 level of exhaustion. On a success, they take half the damage and gain no exhaustion.

##### Pit
The floor of the tunnel has collapsed into a seemingly bottomless pit. The pit actually leads to another layer of the Abyss, one that is immediately deadly to sentient creatures.
