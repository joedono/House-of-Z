# City of Liches
If Anguisa's demons successfully retrieved the vial of King Samuel's blood from the party, Anguisa will already have the information she needs from King Ensar, the long ancestor to King Samuel, about how he got close to Orcus and stole his wand that one time.

If not, she'll have departed from this place anyway.

The party's goal here is to find allies. In doing so, they will discover what information they can about King Ensar, what he knows about Thanatos and Orcus, and what Anguisa's plan might be. Therefore, their eventual goal will be to restore his sanity and lucidity. They can accomplish this either by bringing him the vial of giant's blood they kept from Anguisa's demons, or with the help of Zeethrae, a drow that lives in the shipwreck of the vessel called the Shadow, which is currently ice-locked in The Frozen Sea to the north. Zeethrae helped King Ensar infiltrate Orcus' inner circle in the first place, and could prove to be a good ally to the party.

### City of Reflection
The city itself is silent, cold, and dead. It's layout resembles Loftran but is solely populated with liches and their servants. The city actually functions, unlike most of the other cities on Thanatos. The liches trade with each other and play political games with each other. The city has it's own high-brow brand of lawlessness, since King Ensar is in a vegetative state. It resembles a city run by mob-bosses or crime families.

### Inside the City

### Traversing the Frozen Sea
Zeethrae makes her home in her old pirate ship, The Shadow, which is locked in the ice of The Frozen Sea, amidst many other broken citadels and shipwrecks.

Getting across the sea is a fool's errand. The subconscious idea of this sea is what gave the rulers of Durrstaft the idea for their frozen lake executions. There are frozen skeletal limbs poking out everywhere here. The main hazard is the hundreds of gelatinous cubes that live just under the surface of the ice and slide across its surface. They form an ever-changing maze of dissolving walls.

If the party played their cards right in the City of Liches, they'll have an ice skiff that will allow them to traverse the Frozen Sea without worrying about falling into a cube. They'll still have to deal with the cubes migrating over the surface of the ice, along with other predators (TODO) that fly in the skies above.

### The Shadow
Zeethrae's vessel is mostly intact. She lives here with 6 other drow hunters, plotting on how to overthrow Orcus. They are VERY distrustful of outsiders, usually believing them to be Orcus' agents coming to foil their plans or capture them. In truth, Orcus couldn't care less. Seethrae and her band aren't even any annoyance.
