# The Conduit
The players will fall through the portal in Landgrave's Folley opened by the death of the juvenile kraken and end up at The Conduit on the eastern border of Thanatos. Anguisa will be no where in sight.

## Ambush
The party will be almost immediately ambushed by demonic scavangers who prey on new arrivals.

## Verna's Reaction
Being in the Abyss will cause an intense reaction with Verna, the dwarven spirit that resides in Fran's Warhammer. After fighting off the scavangers, Verna will experience a painful transformation as the energy of Thanatos attempts to sever her bonds with the hammer. Her strong bond with Fran will prevent her from being swept away entirely, but she'll be energized by the plane and gain some new abilitieis.

Verna will be able to manifest as a visible spirit separate from the hammer, but she won't be able to move more than 30 feet away from the hammer on her own.

TODO Figure out more upgrades to Verna. Maybe she attacks alongside Fran, causing attacks with the hammer to deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage. She could also scout ahead, being mechanically identical to the Clarvoyance spell, like the Path of Ancestral Guardians for the Barbarian class.

## Scenery
The Conduit is bordered to the north and west by impassible mountains, and to the east by the Sea of Blood. This leaves the party with little choice which direction to hike in. They'll either hike straight south into The Deadlands, or they'll take a slight detour south-west and explore Skullmount.
