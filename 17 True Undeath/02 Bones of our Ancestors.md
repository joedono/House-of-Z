# Bones of our Ancestors
The party begins to explore Thanatos

## Skullmount
A 4,000ft tall pile/mountain of bones. The various creatures who's bones are here still have wills of their own and attempt to reform into their proper skeletons. The overriding will is Retaw, Draffnir's brother and one of the primary creators of humans. His will mixes with the will of the various other creatures here and causes the bones to come together in haphazard creations.

### Malformed Skeletons
If the party attempts to scale the mountain, treat this more as a skill challenge than a battle. Maybe ALL of the bones are constantly moving, making this a challenge similar to trying to climb a quicksand mountain. The party could try to sail up the mountain, navigating the "currents" of bones as they snake their way this way and that. They have to destroy any skeletons that form into something coherent and dangerous, like a shark or a gorilla. Treat any dangerous malformed creatures as minions.

If the party falls into the current, have them take a ton of bludgeoning damage and be spit out at the bottom of the mountain.

### Caleb
The asshole prison guard turned murderous Yuan-Ti has one more cameo to make in this campaign. He won't pose much of a threat to the party, but he'll try to heckle them one last time before they either obliterate him or just sail past him.

### Retaw
The intact skull of Draffnir's brother sits at the peak of Skullmount, giving it its name. Retaw's essence is also exerting the same desire to reform himself as the rest of the bones of Skullmount, but he's having just as little luck as the rest of the creatures. The skull, being intact, is still capable of lucid communication.

Retaw treats the party as though they are lost children visiting their failure of a father. He'll be happy to see them but ashamed that they have to see him in such a state. Meeting Retaw will be the first time the party has a chance to hear the true story of the creation of the world, as well as the current state of affairs of the Dragons and Celestials, possibly providing the final piece to the puzzle about what Anguisa has been trying to do.

Retaw will be able to completely explain the purpose of Anguisa's list and what she needs from Thanatos, the Wand of Orcus. He is also the source of the letters from the dead that people on the Material Plane have been receiving.

Unfortunately, the party won't be able to do anything to help Retaw out of his predicament. Trying to help Retaw will be the same effort as emptying the ocean with a teacup.


## The Deadlands
A massive (mostly symbolic) graveyard. There are billions of gravestones here, one for every soul lost to the Abyss after death. There isn't any danger of the denizens of the graves attacking the party in the form of ghosts or zombies, but the keepers of the graveyard don't like trespassers. The wind over the graveyard carries the sound of laughter.

### Grave Tenders
The Deadlands are tended to by Chasme and their pet Barlguras. Each Chasme usually has 2-3 Barlguras that serve as enforcers and heavy labor. They'll watch the party from afar, hiding among the graves. They might try to ambush the party while they sleep, but the Tiny Hut will prevent that. They'll stalk the party through the Deadlands, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

While the Chasmes and Barlguras are able to handle most of the tending, a large number of Cacklers also tend to the graves. The party encounters these as if they are wildlife. They scatter at the sight of the party, but may stick their nose out if a fight breaks out between the party and the tenders.

The party is able to avoid angering the grave tenders by promising their soul to the cemetary after they die. The contract is sealed by giving the Chasme something a possession that uniquely belongs to each party-member. As the Chasme have no knowledge of the party and little magical detection abilities, the party might be able to convince them that something extremely commonplace is actually unique, such as a single gold coin or a field ration.

### Sinkholes
Thousands of graves and graves-upon-graves have made the footing here EXTREMELY unstable. The party is very likely to discover a sinkhole or pit trap during their travel through the cemetary. If two or more of the party fall into the sinkholes, the Grave Tenders will choose that time to strike or negotiate.


## City of Zombies
City of 10,000 zombies. This area is actually mostly friendly to the party. The people here are simply undead and decaying, but are living in a functioning city. Their current ruler is Garlan, elected by popular vote.

### General Mood
The City of Zombies has all the trappings of a regular city. There are taverns, shops, festivals, markets, weddings, farms, maybe a little bit of industry. Nearly all of it is just appearances though. Since the zombies don't need to eat or sleep, they can't truly get drunk, and the environment of Thanatos doesn't permit anything truly nutritious to grow, most of the city industries aren't real. Taverns serve rotting meat and disgusting liquid for food and drinks. Farms grow poisonous weeds. Any zombie acting drunk is just acting. Beds are facsimilies and horribly uncomfortable to the living. Half of the zombie only feign sleep, and half of them sleep in holes in the ground.
 
There is diversity though. Many races have ended up here. Children too. There's also a mixture of speeds. Some of the zombies are shamblers and some can move normally. All are lucid and aware though. Those that aren't wander out of the city and are tended to by the Chasme, but the undead regenerative powers of the plane cause that to happen really slowly.

### General City Encounters
1. Guards at the Gate - The gates to the city are guarded by a squardon of guards with spears. Two of them approach the party as they approach the gate. They groan out "papers please" and will attempt to bar the party from entering. They don't say anything else to the party, only repeat "papers please." They'll be satisfied and grant entry to the party if they are given anything resembling paper.
2. Orphan Pickpockets - A small group of zombie children shamble past the party at varying speeds and ineptly attempt to pickpocket them. If caught, the children are ashamed and apologetic. They're simply recreating things they did when they were alive.
3. Town Crier - A zombie stands on a shoebox and attempts to give announcements to the street and boardwalk. His vocal cords give out halfway through and the remaining announcements are intelligible grunts and moans.
4. Pet Escape - One of the zombies is out walking his Hell Hound. The decaying leash gives out and the creature attacks the the party for 1d4 rounds before the owner can catch up with it and calm it down.
5. Busker - An acrobatic pair of zombies are performing a street act. The first half of the act is fairly normal. One of the acrobat's arms falls off in the middle of the act. The zombie crowd goes silent. The other acrobat picks up the arms, looks at them for a beat, walks over to his partner, rips his partner's leg off, then starts juggling them. If the party puts any money into the acrobats' hat, they'll continue adding more body parts to the loop until one acrobat is juggling every part of his partner.
6. Campaigner - A zombie petitioner is attempting to drum up support for Charles Krimshaw, a political rival to Garlan and who is running against him in the next election. This petitioner is VERY against Garlan as a ruler. Doesn't like his policies, etc. This will likely be the first time the party hears Garlan's name.
7. Disagreement - A pair of zombies accuse a zombie shoppkeeper of ripping them off or offering them a bad deal. A comical fight breaks out with loose fists fly in half-hearted blows. The fight ends abruptly when the merchant's head is knocked off. One of the patrons calmly gives the head back to the merchant, the offending patrons offer a muttered apology, and everyone walks away like nothing happened.
8. Statues - Periodically throughout the city, the party will see groups of zombies tearing down an old statue and erecting a new one. The old one will resemble a bearded elf with various pieces missing, two left hands, and a tail. The new statue will resemble a dragonborn, also with pieces missing, and with a distinguished, but partially ruined, crest on his breast. A successful History check will let the party see the symbol of the Red Drakes in the ruined symbol. The statue is commemorating the election of Garlan as ruler of the City of Zombies.
9. Fishing - The party's wanderings take them to docks on an inlet from the Sea of Blood. A trio of zombies are fly-fishing, attempting to catch something from the Sea of Blood. Of course, no sane person would attempt this. These zombies are just attempting to live out what they did when they were alive. However, one of them catches something. Something huge that leaps out of the blood, catches the zombie's line, and attempts to drag him into the Sea. The other two zombies will attempt to help him, but without intervention from the players, the zombie with the catch will be yanked off his feet and pulled into the Sea.
10. Lemonade Stand - A zombie will be attempting to sell a new sweet drink he had a dream about. He's calling it lemonade. The party can try it, but it will be made from cackler blood and be mildly poisonous.

### Audience with the King
Word will travel slowly to Garlan that a party of still-living adventurers has arrived. Garlan will dispatch a messenger to bring Valmar and friends to the "castle" for an audience.

The castle is, like the rest of the city, a poor imitation of a castle on the Material Plane. It is ripped banners, broken stone, barely lit torches, and reeks of death. The messenger will escort the party past the guards and into the castle to the throneroom, where Garlan waits.

Garlan is only a little more lucid than the average citizen of the Coty of Zombies. He remembers Valmar, Fran, Ardin, and Ibal. He is quick to reassure Valmar that he doesn't bear him any further ill will. He vaguely remembers his time as a Revenant and insists that the vengeance curse that gripped him has faded and taken his basic urge for vengeance with it. Not to mention that the vengeance was technically fulfilled. He apologies anyway.

Garlan was elected to the position of King less than a week ago, and doesn't really want it. He's just the only dragonborn zombie in the city and was basically elected out of novelty. Things don't change much in the City of Zombies. He is only just starting to get used to his new position and doesn't want any help escaping to the material plane or some other after life.

### Garlan's Quest
If the party has not been to Skullmount yet, use this questline as a way to get them there and interacting with Retaw. Garlan is missing his lower jaw bone. He can still speak, but he is difficult to understand. The only bones here that don't technically belong to another creature are on Skullmount. If the party could go and retrieve a jawbone from the mountain of bones, Garlan would be very grateful.

If the party has already been to Skullmount, then Garlan's lower jaw will have washed down the River Styx and be somewhere in the Bonemeal Desert.

Garlan gives the party one of his finger bones. It will vibrate when the party is close to his jawbone.

As a reward for returning his jawbone, Garlan will give the party his tail. Due to his death at the hands of the spirit of Anguisa, Zombie Garlan has a unique connection to her. When suspended in water, Garlan's Tail will point towards Anguisa. This gives the party perpetual directions for where Anguisa is. Currently, the tail will point west. Anguisa is attempting to raise an army in The Valley of the Crypt Things, but she's having trouble as the undead kings are locked in combat with each other.
