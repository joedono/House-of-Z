# Bones of our Ancestors
The party begins to explore Thanatos

## Skullmount
A 4,000ft tall pile/mountain of bones. The various creatures who's bones are here still have wills of their own and attempt to reform into their proper skeletons. The overriding will is Retaw, Draffnir's brother and one of the primary creators of humans. His will mixes with the will of the various other creatures here and causes the bones to come together in haphazard creations.

### Malformed Skeletons
If the party attempts to scale the mountain, treat this more as a skill challenge than a battle. Maybe ALL of the bones are constantly moving, making this a challenge similar to trying to climb a quicksand mountain. The party could try to sail up the mountain, navigating the "currents" of bones as they snake their way this way and that. They have to destroy any skeletons that form into something coherent and dangerous, like a shark or a gorilla. Treat any dangerous malformed creatures as minions.

If the party falls into the current, have them take a ton of bludgeoning damage and be spit out at the bottom of the mountain.

### Caleb
The asshole prison guard turned murderous Yuan-Ti has one more cameo to make in this campaign. He won't pose much of a threat to the party, but he'll try to heckle them one last time before they either obliterate him or just sail past him.

### Retaw
The intact skull of Draffnir's brother sits at the peak of Skullmount, giving it its name. Retaw's essence is also exerting the same desire to reform himself as the rest of the bones of Skullmount, but he's having just as little luck as the rest of the creatures. The skull, being intact, is still capable of lucid communication.

Retaw treats the party as though they are lost children visiting their failure of a father. He'll be happy to see them but ashamed that they have to see him in such a state. Meeting Retaw will be the first time the party has a chance to hear the true story of the creation of the world, as well as the current state of affairs of the Dragons and Celestials, possibly providing the final piece to the puzzle about what Anguisa has been trying to do.

Retaw will be able to completely explain the purpose of Anguisa's list.

Unfortunately, the party won't be able to do anything to help Retaw out of his predicament. Trying to help Retaw will be the same effort as emptying the ocean with a teacup.


## The Deadlands
A massive (mostly symbolic) graveyard. There are billions of gravestones here, one for every soul lost to the Abyss after death. There isn't any danger of the denizens of the graves attacking the party in the form of ghosts or zombies, but the keepers of the graveyard don't like trespassers. The wind over the graveyard carries the sound of laughter.

### Grave Tenders
The Deadlands are tended to by Chasme and their pet Barlguras. Each Chasme usually has 2-3 Barlguras that serve as enforcers and heavy labor. They'll watch the party from afar, hiding among the graves. They might try to ambush the party while they sleep, but the Tiny Hut will prevent that. They'll stalk the party through the Deadlands, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

While the Chasmes and Barlguras are able to handle most of the tending, a large number of Cacklers also tend to the graves. The party encounters these as if they are wildlife. They scatter at the sight of the party, but may stick their nose out if a fight breaks out between the party and the tenders.

The party is able to avoid angering the grave tenders by promising their soul to the cemetary after they die. The contract is sealed by giving the Chasme something a possession that uniquely belongs to each party-member. As the Chasme have no knowledge of the party and little magical detection abilities, the party might be able to convince them that something extremely commonplace is actually unique, such as a single gold coin or a field ration.

### Sinkholes
Thousands of graves and graves-upon-graves have made the footing here EXTREMELY unstable. The party is very likely to discover a sinkhole or pit trap during their travel through the cemetary. If two or more of the party fall into the sinkholes, the Grave Tenders will choose that time to strike or negotiate.


## City of Zombies
City of 10,000 zombies. This area is actually mostly friendly to the party. The people here are simply undead and decaying, but are living in a functioning city. Their current ruler is Garlan, elected by popular vote.
