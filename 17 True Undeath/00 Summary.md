# True Undeath
Anguisa has flown through a portal to the Abyss created by the death of a ritually charged juvenile kraken. Her goal is to make it to Thanatos, the layer of the Abyss ruled by Orcus and a layer ruled by undeath. Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any creatures foolish enough to journey here.

Anguisa needs to obtain either The Wand of Orcus. To do that, she has to execute a heist to steal it or defeat Orcus himself.

While she's here, the undead energy of the plane will increase her power. Exact effects TBD.

## Anguisa's Heist
Anguisa's objective in Thanatos is to steal The Wand of Orcus, bring it back to the Material Plane, and use it's undead energy as fuel and direction for the ritual to raise Draffnir as her undead thrall.

Her first objective will be to find allies. Her first stop will be the City of Zombies, but she'll be completely rebuffed by Garlan due to their history and she'll leave immediately. Her next stop will be The Valley of the Crypt Things. She'll lend her allegience to one of the undead kings and grant him a decisive victory against the others. She'll then promise him a kingdom of his own once he agrees to help take down Orcus. Of course, the victory is temporary as the other kings will rise in short order and combine their forced to take down the new solo victor. The party is likely to arrive here while the lone victor is waging a war for his un-life against the other kings.

Anguisa will also learn about The Lich King and his exploits.

The only being who has ever successfully stolen it was the Lich King. He only held it for a few minutes before Orcus found him and destroyed any lucidity he had before banishing him to the City of Liches. A hollow king for a hollow throne. The Lich King managed to get close enough to steal the wand by ingratiating himself into Orcus' service, performing great deads in his name, and generally proving to be a trustworthy guy.

Anguisa's next objective will be to restore enough lucidity to The Lich King in order to find out how he managed to steal the Wand of Orcus. She'll journey to The City of Liches to assess things and find out what's needed.
