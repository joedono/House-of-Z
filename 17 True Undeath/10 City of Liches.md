# City of Liches
If Anguisa's demons successfully retrieved the vial of King Samuel's blood from the party, Anguisa will already have the information she needs from King Ensar, the long ancestor to King Samuel, about how he got close to Orcus and stole his wand that one time.

If not, she'll have departed from this place anyway.

The party's goal here is to find allies. In doing so, they will discover what information they can about King Ensar, what he knows about Thanatos and Orcus, and what Anguisa's plan might be. Therefore, their eventual goal will be to restore his sanity and lucidity. They can accomplish this either by bringing him the vial of giant's blood they kept from Anguisa's demons, or with the help of Zeethrae, a drow that lives in the shipwreck of the vessel called the Shadow, which is currently ice-locked in The Frozen Sea to the north. Zeethrae helped King Ensar infiltrate Orcus' inner circle in the first place, and could prove to be a good ally to the party.

The city bears some resemblance to Irithyll of the Boreal Valley from Dark Souls 3.

### City of Reflection
The city itself is silent, cold, and dead. It's layout resembles Loftran but is solely populated with liches and their servants. The city actually functions, unlike most of the other cities on Thanatos. The liches trade with each other and play political games with each other. The city has it's own high-brow brand of lawlessness, since King Ensar is in a vegetative state. It resembles a city run by mob-bosses or crime families. Every creature here is skeletal.

### Inside the City
The goal here is to eventually lead the party to the Frozen Waste, The Shadow, and meeting Zeethrae. She can give the party information about how to communicate with King Ensar or restore his lucidity.

#### Sights and Locations
1. A functional central park with a pair of liches engaged in a game of chess. All of the greenery looks like its made of ice.
2. The Third Finger - a busy teahouse. Owned by a skeletal elf named Almaith
3. Thrashings & Threads - a dark reflection of Threads & Thrashings. A tailor. Owned by a skeletal half-orc named Ganeen
4. Kikraw GNC - a dark reflection of Warwick GNC, sells snake oils and poisonous remedies. Owned by a skeletal human named Arther
5. Draining Mines - mines located north-west of the city. They may once have been prosperous mines, but now the precious metals down there suck aether and life energy out of nearby creatures. No one goes down there anymore.
6. Seat of War - has guardposts throughout the city, but all the guards are barely-lucid skeletons. There's very little law-enforcement in this city.
7. Embers and Ashes - magic shop. Sells advanced potions and spell scrolls. Owned by a demi-lich named Bastion. Has an inept homunculous assistant named Spit.
8. Fool's Errand - A traveler's shop. Rents skeletal horses and sells ice skiffs. The party will need these to traverse the Frozen Waste without worrying about the gelatinous cubes
9. Cold Coins - a bank and exchange shop. Run by a smooth-talking lich named Zevlor. Will exchange gp for souls at a rate of 10gp / soul

All the shops take payment in souls. All prices are appropriate at a rate of 10gp / soul.

#### Events
Immediately upon entering the city, the party will be accosted by three "poor" liches offering paltry scraps and trinkets for everyone's souls. They're not so easily fooled as the Chasme in the Deadlands, but they're begging for scraps, not demanding payment. They can be shooed away like common beggers and won't bother the party too much.

A minor parade will form around a pair of noble liches, known as Lord and Lady Elderchain. If they notice the party, Lady Elderchain will ask her husband to capture the party to be her new "pets". The party could play the part, as the Elderchains have access to King Ensar and have a meeting with him that night. Or the party could rebel and instigate a fight with the Elderchains' servants and several over-zealous admirers.

Around "noon", a pair of noble liches named Rashaan and Vectimarus will come together in the street. A lower-tier skeleton will use Thaumatergy to boom his voice and announce that one of the liches has declared a slight from the other lich, and according to tradition, a duel must commence to restore honor. The pair of liches will proceed to decimate much of the street and surrounding houses with their magical duel. Hopefully, the party can avoid becoming collateral damage.

A demilich named Scythe will attempt to tempt the party down an alley, claiming to have their "greatest desire". If the party follows it down the alley, it'll offer a "Potion of Wish" in eschange for their souls. If they refuse, the demilich and it's 4 Minotaur Skeletons will attack the party. The potion is, of course, completely fake. If the party doesn't follow the demilich into the alley, it won't pursue them.

### Traversing the Frozen Sea
Zeethrae makes her home in her old pirate ship, The Shadow, which is locked in the ice of The Frozen Sea, amidst many other broken citadels and shipwrecks.

Getting across the sea is a fool's errand. The subconscious idea of this sea is what gave the rulers of Durrstaft the idea for their frozen lake executions. There are frozen skeletal limbs poking out everywhere here. The main hazard is the hundreds of gelatinous cubes that live just under the surface of the ice and slide across its surface. They form an ever-changing maze of dissolving walls.

If the party played their cards right in the City of Liches, they'll have an ice skiff that will allow them to traverse the Frozen Sea without worrying about falling into a cube. They'll still have to deal with the cubes migrating over the surface of the ice, along with other predators (TODO) that fly in the skies above.

### The Shadow
Zeethrae's vessel is mostly intact. She lives here with 6 other drow hunters, plotting on how to overthrow Orcus. They are VERY distrustful of outsiders, usually believing them to be Orcus' agents coming to foil their plans or capture them. In truth, Orcus couldn't care less. Zeethrae and her band aren't even any annoyance.
