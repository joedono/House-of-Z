# Valley of the Crypt Things
The party is likely to catch up to Anguisa here. She is currently embroiled in attempting to bolster one of the undead kings that rules over this valley with enough demonic allies and tactical advice to cement him in a position of semi-permanent influence and control over territory. She's doing this to acquire the king's allegience in her quest to steal the Wand of Orcus or defeat a powerful demon.

This will be the party's first actual fight with Ghost Anguisa.

## Finding the Valley
The Burning Waste and the mountains that surround the valley make up a trecherous labyrinth that eventually connects to The Endless Maze, the layer of the Abyss ruled over by Baphomet. Getting through the maze is a horrible ordeal. Use some portions of The Maze setting book to fill this in with appropriate hazards.
