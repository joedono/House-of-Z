## Prison Guards & Prisoners

### Malcom - DECEASED
Male Human Prison Guard. Does the rounds on the players' cells. Is sympathetic for their plights, but won't listen to anything they have to say. Has a wife and daughter at home that he's always talking about. Met in the prison in chapter 1.

### Gorma - DECEASED
Female Half-Orc Prison Guard. Does rounds and brings the players their food rations. Not friendly at all, but not sadistic. Views prisoners as maggots deserving of the worst punishments. They're blights on society and are getting exactly what they deserve. Any of the players who believe they were framed are lying. Met in the prison in chapter 1.

### Caleb - TRANSFORMED INTO YUAN-TI
Male Human Prison Guard. As sadistic as they come. Enjoys torturing the prisoners, but his fear of Gorma keeps him in line...usually. Might be caught trying to poison one of the players' rations, or jab them with a stick. Met in the prison in chapter 1. Met again outside the warehouse on Linen Street, a full fledged member of the Venomers.

### Eldon
Male Halfling Prisoner. Was thrown in jail the same day as Ibal (5 days ago) for stealing from a noble who was out to market. The crime absolutely doesn't fit the punishment, which Eldon won't shut up about. But the high profile of the victim means that Eldon will probably get quite the disproportionate punishment. When he's not talking about his crime, Eldon is quite friendly and talkative. He eagerly asks the other prisoners their life stories and borders on being annoying. Met in the prison in chapter 1.

### Elena and Kristina
Malcom's wife and daughter. Met in the House of Sunlight in chapter 1. Gave the party her husband's signet ring which will allow them passage into the Seat of War.

### Faldren

Red tiefling. Works as a doorman for Makaria. Very Geaves-mannerisms, such as the tendency to say "mmmmmm, yessss" in a monotone voice.

---

### Enna Nailo
Female half-elf. Childhood friend of Archebald Elmwall. Noblewoman in her own right. Her husband owns a failing textile company, which includes the warehouse and shop on Linen Street. Archebald helps Enna's family out every so often. Their friendship is precious to Enna, but she was always jealous of Archebald's success, making her a potential suspect in his murder.

### Seebo Timbers
Male gnome. Former business partner to Archebald Elmwall. Archebald dissolved their partnership after Seebo tried to convince Archebald to invest in Seebo's slave trading business. Seebo went into business for himself, but without the startup investment, his slave trading business never really took off. Seebo resents Archebald for denying this opportunity, making Seebo a potential suspect in his murder.

### Aiden Collander
Male Human Merchant. Prominent (and loud) merchant of fresh fruits and fine wines. Met in the House of Sunlight. Met again while searching for Mimic Ivy.

## Wizard's College

### High Magus Vilafor
High Magus at the Wizard's College. A stuck-up old geezer who holds the keys to the forbidden section of the wizard's library. He has a familiar named Pookie that he dotes on extensively, with baby-talk and everything.

### Pookie
Vilafor’s familiar. Usually a sprite. Pookie is sick of all the baby-naming and sick of being talked down to by Vilafor. So sick that she’s likely to give the players the passcode to the Forbidden Section of the Wizard’s Library just to spite Vilafor.

## Seat of War

### Harold and Byron
A human and dwarf soldier. Part of the city guard. The party meets them in the trauma ward at the Seat of War. They were unaffected by the quelling effect of the sigils and their mental state is deteriorating due to them witnessing the shadows come alive and murder people.

## Hatching Stone Mines

### Foreman Clast
Half-orc miner and de factor leader of the mining coalition assigned to the mines. He'll be the primary source of information for the players. Believes in an honest days work. Developed a drinking problem after the accident. Blames himself for the technical failure, despite there being nothing he could have done about it. Met at the Hatching Stone Mines.

### Quartermaster Heath Levenworth
Human quartermaster for the miners. Works in the storeroom and handles requests for equipment. The players will meet him when they go to procure aether filtration suits. A kind old soul. Been working in the mines for 40 years. Wishes he could still get in there an do some actual mining. Met at the Hatching Stone Mines.

### Engineers Avery and Abel Halverstone
Twin dwarf engineers. They're fresh hires, although they know the engineers who were on duty when the accident happened. They're extremely focused on their work and don't talk to people more than they have to. They know how to fix the lift, but Clast forbade it for fear of others being tempted to go down to the Deep Floor. Met at the Hatching Stone Mines.

### Ex-Engineer Wind O'Leaf
Half-elf engineer. Not actually at the mines. Was the engineer on duty at the time of the accident. His blunder lead to the timing belt tearing and the lift crashing down onto the Deep Floor, stranding several miners (including his wife) on the Deep Floor with a hoard of monsters bearing down on them. Wind has been an emotional wreck ever since and has very nearly spent all of his money on whores to silence the screams he hears in his dreams. The players will not meet him at the mines, but may run into him somewhere in the city.

### Keth Clast
A survivor of the lift disaster three months ago, and Foreman Clast's brother (half-orc). He has managed to survive down here due to his ingenuity and determination. He has managed to keep his filtration suit functioning by patching it with scraps from the other miners and adventurers who were stranded down here with him. Despite that, he is showing signs of Stage 7 Aether Poisoning. He's been surviving on rations and the meat of the creatures down here, which of course causes his aether poisoning to get worse. He'll have a noticeable bulge on the back of his head, but the filtration suit will prevent the players from seeing what it is. Of course, it's a crystal growth on the back of his skull. Met in the Deep Floor of the Hatching Stone Mines.

## Misc

### Kathra Dankil
Dwarven woman. Clerk in the royal court house. Most likely to collect Ibal's statement. Very dismissive and sticks to her routine, not unlike the bank clerks from the Witcher.

### Linda Linen
Female elven owner of The Softest Sheet, a linen shop in the Textile District. Places a high value on taste in clothing, to the point where her way of saying "hello" is to evaluate and criticize/compliment a person's outfit. Met in her shop. Gave Ardin two new cloaks and information about the conversion ritual in her warehouse.

### Tabitha
She's a wirey human with thick glasses who takes great pride in her work. She's the greatest alchemist in Loftran. She'll offer to sell the players the recipe for a Panacea potion for 10,000gp. Since they don't have that much, she'll give it to them in exchange for being part of her "living trials" program. She'll give them a magical bag and say that every so often, she sends potions to her "subjects" along with a sheet of parchment. The parchment has instructions on it, whether to drink or pour the liquid on something. The person at the other end of the bag must follow the instructions, write the result on the parchment, and send it back through the bag. She expects this to be done within a day. Met in her shop. Successfully contracted the party.

### Helen
Tabitha's elven assistant. A young woman, especially by elven standards. She's survived longer than any of Tabitha's previous assistants, which gets her some special privileges in the shop. Met in Tabitha's shop.

### Rat Man Jenkins
An insane human who lives in the Loftran sewers. Has become a bit of a scary bedtime story for the peasants of Loftran. Harmless, but creepy.

## Villains

### Sisava

He's a loyal follower of Zehir and is attempting to enact Zehir's will on the world by transforming all of its inhabitants into loyal Yuan-ti acolytes of Zehir.

### Viserion
An ancient black dragon. Responsible for the death of Archebald Elmwall, the destruction of Ardin's village, and gifting Sisava with the components needed for the transformation ritual that threatened all of Loftran.
