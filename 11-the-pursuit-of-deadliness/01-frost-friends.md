# Frost Friends
The party is making their way up the mountains to Durrstaft. It's been 50-60 days since the party defeated Katarina Tsolka. The party left the Snow Mutant alive, and it's been busy.

Possible New Friends:
* Bheur Hag: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bheur-hag
* Mammoth: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mammoth
* Snowy Owlbear: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/snowy-owlbear
* Skeletal Owlbear: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/skeletal-owlbear <-- might be particularly nasty for the party
* Revenant: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/revenant <-- maybe the body of Garlan, the red dragonborn who Anguisa's soul killed. Maybe he blames Valmar for his death.
* Troll: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/troll
* Young Remorhaz: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/young-remorhaz

If the Bheur Hag is involved, have her discover the Snow Mutant, wounded and frightened in the cold. She'd immediately see the creature's hatred for people, and nurture and heal it back to full strength.

If the Hag is not involved, have the Snow Mutant become the alpha of a pack of whatever creatures it comes across, with the exception of the Revenant. Have Garlan rise up, his conviction to take revenge on Valmar for killing him causing him to rise as a Revenant.
