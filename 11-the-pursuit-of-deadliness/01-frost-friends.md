# Frost Friends
The party is making their way up the mountains to Durrstaft. It's been 50-60 days since the party defeated Katarina Tsolka. The party left the Snow Mutant alive, and it's been busy.

## Travel
The party is likely to use either Valmar's new skills or Ibal's sister to quickly cast Teleportation Circle and get them to their manor in Loftran. From there, they'll have to somehow get up to the Durrstaft Mountains and Frostfall Pass. It's an 8 hour trip on horseback to the foot of the mountains, and then a two day treacherous hike through the mountains to get to Durrstaft.

Have the Bheur Hag discover the Snow Mutant, wounded and frightened in the cold. She'd immediately see the creature's hatred for people, and nurture and heal it back to full strength. The two of them will delight in harassing travelers and have been doing so for the past couple weeks. There has been only one courier sent out to Durrstaft and it disappeared.

The Hag also aided Garlan, the dragonborn from the Red Drakes, to rise as a Revenant bent on revenge against Valmar. He believes that Valmar is a Black Dragon in disguise who killed him in an attempt to retrieve his egg. As a Revenant, Garlan cannot be convinced to call off his assault, even if the party has removed Anguisa from Valmar.

Finally, have the blind Owlbear the party saved from the Apes rise as a Skeletal Owlbear with scaring on the skull area around its eye sockets.
