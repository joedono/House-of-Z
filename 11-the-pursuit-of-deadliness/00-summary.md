# Summary
Viserion has escaped The Heavenly Cay with Anguisa's Soul. He now has her soul, her skull, the Loftran Leyline Magic, and the spellbook from the clerics of Thorm. He has bodily material, soul essence, a significant source of power, and access to the True Resurrection spell. That's everything he needs in order to resurrect Anguisa. Now, he needs to get all these materials to the site of her death, an ancient temple just outside of Durrstaft.

The party will probably attempt to pursue Viserion east, but since he can fly and they can't, they'll be far behind unless they can figure something out. Ibal or Ardin might remember that they wrote down the runes for the teleportation circle in Loftran, and that Ibal's sister is a powerful wizard. She could at least get them past Seacracker Islands, shaving a whole week off their journey.

They probably still won't make it in time, as it's at least a day's hike from Loftran to the Frostfall Pass.

It's been 50-60 days since the party encountered Katarina Tsolka and her Snow Mutant. The party left the Snow Mutant alive, and it's been busy.
