# Summary
The party has a list of locations to investigate that they found in Visera's garden:
- **Anguisa's Skull - Kornith Forest**
- Anguisa's Soul - Durrstahft *vessel missing??*
- **Loftran Leyline Magic**
- Abyss
- Pelvis - Third Finger Peak Mountain
- Finger Bones x3 - Seacracker Islands
- **Blood of the Giants**
- Spine - Mount Stratha
- Skull - East of Southspark?
- Ribs - Lindenvale?
- Other Bones - Unknown

It'll be completely up to them which they want to try investigating. They'll be able to get to the Abyss if/when they solve the riddle of the Eloreth Brownie and open the locked door in the mansion. The rest can simply be traveled to.

If they need a push, have someone mention that the royal family of Loftran is known for having the "blood of giants" running through their veins, which will be a clue that Viserion has King Samuel of Loftran with him.

## Next Steps
The party is likely to turn in their IOU from the Queen after learning of Isabella's survival and getting her testimony and her wish to acquit Ibal of her husband's murder. They're likely to make good on their desire for a ship. The Queen will offer them a choice between an unfurnished Brigantine that is seaworthy and in good repair, and a [Folding Boat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/folding-boat). She'll take them down to the Giantvein River, which borders Loftran, to present the choice to the party.

If they ask for something else, deal with it accordingly.

The list the party found should give them a todo list of places to visit. If they have trouble choosing, have them receive a message from Tabitha that kicks off the Snowstalkers module and sends them to either Durrstahft or Lindenvale to the north.

If they think of it, they can inquire as to whether Isabella Elmwall was seen recently. They'll discover that there's a record of her leaving the city a couple days ago, just before the ritual was stopped by the players. The players can learn that she boarded a boat heading north, but they won't learn that she'll have turned West to go to the Seacracker Islands in search of Giant Finger Bones.

### Snowstalker's Differences
Tabitha will be expecting a shipment *from* Durrstahft by way of the mountain pass. It hasn't arrived, and she's worried, more for the lost material than any lost life or injury.

The *special order* is a Black Dragon Egg. It is the long-dormant offspring of Viserion and Anguisa. Viserion doesn't know that it exists, as Anguisa was killed and sealed before she could hatch it. Seeing the egg will provoke an intense reaction from Anguisa's soul inside Valmar/Liara, giving them a headache and hearing a faint voice in their head. The egg can be hatched by submerging it in boiling poison liquid. Tabitha thought the package was just the egg-shell ("nearly whole" she was told). She planned on using shavings from the egg shell in her potions. She didn't know there was still a living dragon inside.
