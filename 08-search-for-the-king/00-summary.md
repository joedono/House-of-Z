# Summary
Viserion left the city with a Spiritwell Flower grown under the Elmwall Estate, and King Samuel of Loftran as a hostage. Viserion is planning to reawaken the giants who formed the world and warred over the land before the time of man. Of course, doing so will visit untold destruction on anything small, including mankind. The royal family is actually descended from giants, so their blood holds the key to the ritual. The Spiritwell Flower was grown out of special soil and is imbued with the power of the Heartswall District in Loftran, under which is the remains of the heart of the Grand Giant, the most powerful giant of all from ancient times.
