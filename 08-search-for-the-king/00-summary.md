# Summary
The party has a list of locations to investigate that they found in Visera's garden:
- Abyss
- Third Finger Peak Mountain
- Seacracker Islands
- Mount Stratha
- Mountains E of Southspark
- Lindenvale?

It'll be completely up to them which they want to try investigating. They'll be able to get to the Abyss if/when they solve the riddle of the Eloreth Brownie and open the locked door in the mansion. The rest can simply be traveled to.

If they need a push, have someone mention that the royal family of Loftran is known for having the "blood of giants" running through their veins, which will be a clue that Viserion has King Samuel of Loftran with him.

## Finger Peak Mountains
This is where Visera believes there to be a pelvis from a giant. The pelvis is deep underground, inside the third mountain, which is also an inactive volcano.

The Finger Peaks are a hardpan desert, dominated by five large mountains. Very barren with little life, but sinister beasts lurk beneath the surface. It is the perfect place to for ancient ruins or a hidden laboratory or church to reside. The only settlement is the town of Southspark, just on the eastern edge of the mountains.

## Seacracker Islands
This is where Visera believes there to be several finger bones from the giants. Ibal lived around here. The finger bones are at the bottom of the sea, in various places around the islands.

The Heavenly Cay is a mostly elven city. The elves who live here are all sailors as a matter of course, but few make it their profession. The city is dominated by the Ivory Tower, the foremost school of magic on the continent (unless you ask the students at the Wizard's College in Loftran).

## Mount Stratha
This is where Visera believes there to be a spine from a giant. Liara lived around here. The spine is the mountain itself, and it is a simple matter of mining some of the stuff from the peak, but the mountain itself is alive and will try to protect the bones from harvesting.

The tallest peak on the continent. Unbeknownst to the population today, the mountain is actually formed from the spine of the giant. It is dotted with great white rocks that are the remnants of bone, hardened into rock.

## Mountains East of Southspark
This is where Visera believes there to be a skull from a giant. The skull is actually what is making the tornados in this region so unpredictable. It periodically uses the great gales to move itself around the mountains.

These mountains are windswept, but full of life. The unique topography of the mountains funnels winds into blistering gales. Tornados are frequent here, and often wreak havoc on the surrounding grasslands. The nearby town of Southspark is built with its buildings protected from the eastern gales, and it employs "wind watchers" who keep round-the-clock surveillance on the mountains to provide an early warning for approaching storms. The tornados are unpredictable.

## Lindenvale
This is where Visera believes there to be some ribs from a giant. The ribs were used as the primary pillars to construct the great wall around the city of Lindenvale.

Lindenvale is a walled city on the small teardrop-shaped island to the far north. The warmer season only lasts 3 months up there.

## Other Locations

### Hazelton
A mining town located at the foot of Mount Stratha. Hazelton mines ore and precious minerals. It's primary export is iron from within the mountain. It's a nice little township, probably on the verge of being a city. Mount Stratha can be a perfect location for The Snow Stalkers adventure. Tabitha can be the inciter through the bag of sending.

### Bramhold
Located basically in the middle of nowhere, Bramhold is little more than a few houses, some fishing boats, and a confluence of crossroads. It's central location on the continent is the only thing of note here. That, and the amazing fish caught in the lake.
