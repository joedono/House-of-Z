# Summary
The next most likely places the players are to check are Hazelton and Bramhold. They'll be level 5 by this point.

## Hazelton
A mining town located at the foot of Mount Stratha. Hazelton mines ore and precious minerals. It's primary export is iron from within the mountain. It's a nice little township, probably on the verge of being a city. Mount Stratha can be a perfect location for The Snow Stalkers adventure. Tabitha can be the inciter through the bag of sending.

## Bramhold
Located basically in the middle of nowhere, Bramhold is little more than a few houses, some fishing boats, and a confluence of crossroads. It's central location on the continent is the only thing of note here. That, and the amazing fish caught in the lake.
