# General Events

## Stumbling Across an Old Sigil
If they players still haven't elected to investigate a sigil and harvested the Mimic Ivy from the vineyards instead of the farms, then they wouldn't have encountered any of the partially transformed people. Assuming they don't just hole up in the church, have them stumble across an old sigil burned into the ground. See document `02/02a-investigation.sigil`. If they catch Marsh Hansen, he could lead them on his side quest.

## Rally for Poison - DONE
The party might encounter a town preacher, espousing the virtues of poison, how it will burn out your flaws and leave you a pure being. They might point out the party in a "shun the non-believers" moment. The party can ignore him and keep walking, or attempt to instigate something. The crowd might turn on them if they're not careful.

## Yuan-Ti Appearances - DONE
While the party is walking from one destination to another, they start to encounter legitimate Yuan-Ti people, up to Malisons (people with snake heads, arms, or legs). None of these people will be openly hostile towards the party, but if the party catches their eye, they'll have a derisive look, like they're looking at a filthy stain in the carpet. If the party follows one of these people, they'll act completely normal, going about their lives, shopping, meeting friends for lunch, going home, reading, sleeping, etc.

## Missionaries
While the party is at the House of Sunlight at some point, have an incident where a snake-eyed cleric comes to the door handling out pamphlets, advertising having all your sins forgiven and basking in the darkness brought about by our new lord and savior, Zehir. The pamphlet will advertise a "transformation ceremony" that takes place every night now in the old warehouse on Linen Street. See Marsh's side quest. The missionary's shadow will appear to look at the players as they leave.

## City Construction - DONE
The players will notice that buildings are starting to put up really long awnings. They'll be tight-lipped about why, but it's to put more of the city in shade so that the light-sensitive shadow monsters can roam about more easily. The Yuan-Ti aren't overly fond of sunlight either, so the players might see more of them wandering around too.

## Wizard's Study Session
If the party goes back to the Wizard's College, then they'll run into Cathlene and Theresa. The elements haven't changed in the forbidden section. They'll also mention that Cathlene's practical exam is coming up and that her studying hasn't been doing very well. Theresa will remember that some of the party was pulled aside and tested for magical aptitude and suggest that some fresh opponents might help. She'll ask the players if a few of them might consent to a friendly magical duel against Cathlene.

## Drinking and Dancing
If the party decides they need a drink, the tavern where Fran and Theryn were arrested for fighting is called The Bloody Tankard. It's a lower-middle class pub. The regulars usually like to blow off steam. There's a betting board and a fighting ring, but it's rarely used in favor of all-out brawls in the main area. Alternatively, the players can go to The Emerald Glass, a higher class bar with more expensive wine, live music, and good food. If they go to there, they might find Aiden supplying wine to the tavern.

## Makaria Reward
If the players helped Makaria with her Mimic Ivy problem, they'll receive a package from a courier. The package contains two magic items from Table B (DM 144), a bottle of fine wine, and an invitation to a party Makaria is hosting in two weeks at her mansion.

## Monster Evolution
As the nights go on, fewer shadow demons will appear. They'll be replaced with honest-to-goodness monsters that are usually native to the Underdark. They'll always have either darkness or poison qualities, and the majority will have snake-like attributes. Eventually, they'll start appearing during the day too, although they'll wander the streets like common citizens, seen by the populace as little more than stray cats.

## Marsh at the House of Sunlight
--- BOOKMARK ---
One of the times that the party returns to the House of Sunlight, Marsh will be there waiting for them. He'll implore them to help him find his parents.

## King's Decree
Probably after the party finishes at the Wizard's College, they'll learn that the king has imposed a curfew on the city for everyone's safety. The decree will list potential safe houses, such as the college, the Seat of War, the House of Sunlight, and several other places (mostly churches and soldier outposts) throughout the city. The players will also notice increased guard presence and maybe some forced house searches, attempting to root out the traitors to the crown. Two or three days later, the party will hear word of more king's decrees, lifting the curfew, and assuring the populace that the problem has been dealt with. Of course, the problem has not been dealt with, but the king is starting to become affected by the sigils.

Another day or two later, and the king will issue another decree, encouraging people to turn in any "blasphemous traitors to the crown" in to the guards, and saying that they can be recognized by their round pupils. This should come near the end of the adventure, to show that the king has completely lost it and is a full-fledged convert to the Venomers.

## Protection and Concealment
The party may want some form of protection against the ritual that is transforming the city. Sister Thia or Tabitha, the alchemist, will be able to provide a charm that will stave off the effects, but only for a few days. Less if the party spends too much time close to a sigil.
