# Betrayal
During one of the days, Brother Kellen and a couple acolytes will venture out into the city to help anyone they can. They'll return having been affected by the sigils faster than the rest, but no one will suspect anything is wrong, due to the general "there is no war in Loftran" vibe permeating the city. Kellen will be allowed to stay in the church.

## Setup
Kellen has been out and about in the city for at least a day. He investigated one of the sigils, and it poisoned his mind and the minds of the acolytes he brought with him. They were drawn to the source of the ritual and further enslaved. They fed information about the party to the cultists, and were instructed to hinder the party's progress by any means necessary. Being clerics, direct confrontation or murder were out of the question, so Kellen settled on stealing either the Panacea or the Hatching Stone. Considering that the Panacea was harder to make and required rare ingredients, he opted to steal that.

The party will return to the House of Sunlight at twilight on some day. They'll find the church scorched from the inside, as if a magical battle took place here. They'll find Thia, stumbling and bruised. She'll tell the players that she completed the Panacea, then Kellen suddenly hissed at her. His eyes were snake-like. He cast a spell at her, received aid from a couple acolytes, also with snake-eyes, grabbed the Panacea, and fled. Thia recovered quickly enough to run to the window and saw Kellen flee down the road and enter Maple Leaves, a large residential building near the House of Sunlight. Fortunately, Thia still has a few samples of the Panacea. She believes that forcing Kellen and the other acolytes to drink it will bring them to their senses. Alternatively, the party can kill them. As they're about to leave, there will be a green flash **very** close by, which Thia will identify as being almost on top of the Maple Leaves residence hall.

If the players are within the church on the evening when the rituals are complete, the affected acolytes will attempt to distract or disable the players (especially Ibal, who doesn't "sleep"). Kellen will cast Fog Cloud to cover his exit.

Thia will then leave to activate the belltower.

## Arrival
The party arrives on the street just outside the Maple Leaves. There is a flash of green light from either behind or on top of the building, signaling to the players that there is a freshly activated sigil inside. The residence looms menacingly in front of them. Then the screams start and residents start streaming out in a panic.

## Maple Leaves
The party will find a mix of snakes, yuan-ti cultists, and panicked residents inside the Maple Leaves that the players can rescue. After fighting their way through enough of the enemies inside, the party will encounter Kellen giving the Large Hatching Stone to Sisava, the mastermind behind the ritual in Loftran.

Objective: Grab Kellen, feed him the panacea, and escape back into the House of Sunlight's sphere of safety

## Reinforcements
As the battle draws to a close (it doesn't matter which side is winning), Thia will arrive with reinforcements. They will bathe the area outside Maple Leaves with Daylight spells, and start moving around inside, effectively "smoking out" any shadow creatures or Yuan-Ti creatures. Sisava will flee out a window and disappear into the night.

## Aftermath
If Kellen is still alive and takes a dose of the Panacea, he'll come to his senses. He'll apologize profusely to the players. After some time to collect himself and recover, he'll remember that he and his acolytes were coming back to the House of Sunlight. Just as they were passing by Loftran Castle, Kellen's memory goes blank. He remembers flashes of what happened next. A great gate opening with the king's banner, being flanked on all sides by Yuan-Ti, seeing more of them standing guard within a great chamber, a voice saying with authority "Take them down to be converted", being led down a staircase, a dark room with a bubbling cauldron, blood and pain, a dark voice saying "Soon all of you will be mine", then waking up on the road again with a different purpose.

Players advance to level 4 now.
