# Betrayal
During one of the days, Brother Kellen and a couple acolytes will venture out into the city to help anyone they can. They'll return having been affected by the sigils faster than the rest, but no one will suspect anything is wrong, due to the general "there is no war in Loftran" vibe permeating the city. Kellen will be allowed to stay in the church.

## Setup
Kellen has been out and about in the city for at least a day. He investigated one of the sigils, and it poisoned his mind and the minds of the acolytes he brought with him. They were drawn to the source of the ritual and further enslaved. They fed information about the party to the cultists, and were instructed to hinder the party's progress by any means necessary. Being clerics, direct confrontation or murder were out of the question, so Kellen settled on stealing either the Panacea or the Hatching Stone. Considering that the Panacea was harder to make and required rare ingredients, he opted to steal that.

The party will return to the House of Sunlight at twilight on some day. They'll find the church scorched from the inside, as if a magical battle took place here. They'll find Thia, stumbling and bruised. She'll tell the players that she completed the Panacea, then Kellen suddenly hissed at her. His eyes were snake-like. He cast a spell at her, received aid from a couple acolytes, also with snake-eyes, grabbed the Panacea, and fled. Thia recovered quickly enough to run to the window and saw Kellen flee down the road and enter Maple Leaves, a large residential building near the House of Sunlight. Fortunately, Thia still has a few samples of the Panacea. She believes that forcing Kellen and the other acolytes to drink it will bring them to their senses. Alternatively, the party can kill them. As they're about to leave, there will be a green flash **very** close by, which Thia will identify as being almost on top of the Maple Leaves residence hall.

If the players are within the church on the evening when the rituals are complete, the affected acolytes will attempt to distract or disable the players (especially Ibal, who doesn't "sleep"). Kellen will cast Fog Cloud to cover his exit.

Thia will then leave to activate the belltower.

## The Journey
The party arrives on the street just outside the Maple Leaves. There is a freshly activated sigil on the ground just outside the place, and a humanoid figure standing over it. The humandoid is a Yuan-Ti Malison, a cultist from the Venomers. Inside the sigil ring is a Shadow Dragon Wyrmling, a great winged shadow creature. Strewn around are several groups of corpses, three of which rise as Shadows.

#### Shadow Dragon Attributes
Damage Resistances. The dragon has resistance to necrotic damage.
Skill Proficiency: Stealth. The dragon's proficiency bonus is doubled for its Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Living Shadow. While in dim light or darkness, the dragon has resistance to damage that isn't force, psychic, or radiant.
Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the dragon can take the Hide action as a bonus action.
Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the dragon has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
New Action: Bite. If the dragon deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage with its  bite, change that damage type to necrotic.
New Action: Shadow Breath. Any damage-dealing breath weapon possessed by the dragon deals necrotic damage instead of its original damage type. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead shadow rises from its corpse and acts immediately after the dragon in the initiative count. The shadow is under the dragon's control.

## Maple Leaves
After the fight, the party may enter the Maple Leaves. Being just outside the sphere of light granted by the House of Sunlight, the place is mostly abandoned. But the surprise appearance of the sigil just as the sun set has driven the few latecomers inside in a panic. There will be a handful of civilian NPCs for the party to rescue inside the residence hall as they explore.

Objective: Grab Kellen, feed him the panacea, and escape back into the House of Sunlight's sphere of safety

## Reinforcements
As the battle draws to a close (it doesn't matter which side is winning), Thia will arrive with reinforcements. They will bathe the area outside Maple Leaves with Daylight spells, and start moving around inside, effectively "smoking out" any shadow creatures or Yuan-Ti creatures. Sisava will flee out a window and disappear into the night.

## Aftermath
If Kellen is still alive and takes a dose of the Panacea, he'll come to his senses. He'll apologize profusely to the players. After some time to collect himself and recover, he'll remember that he and his acolytes were coming back to the House of Sunlight. Just as they were passing by Loftran Castle, Kellen's memory goes blank. He remembers flashes of what happened next. A great gate opening with the king's banner, being flanked on all sides by Yuan-Ti, seeing more of them standing guard within a great chamber, a voice saying with authority "Take them down to be converted", being led down a staircase, a dark room with a bubbling cauldron, blood and pain, a dark voice saying "Soon all of you will be mine", then waking up on the road again with a different purpose.

Players advance to level 4 now.
