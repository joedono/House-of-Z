# Cave of the Spine
The party, Valmar, Naomi, and Nell start their journey into the cave in search of the source of divine energy that is attracting the ghosts. The injured Spine radiates very strong radiant energy. This will cause random radiant-aligned spells to go off in the cave.

Valmar rolled an 11 on his attunement to the holy amulet
