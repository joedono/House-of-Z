# Vezdrikex's Lair
https://www.reddit.com/r/battlemaps/comments/pkvoit/death_tyrant_lair_65x95/

This is the last floor of my latest mega dungeon and the horror grows ad infinitum. After days of wandering through cave systems full of monsters, we now reach the source of the madness that our heroes have already encountered up to this point. A Death Tyrant has set up his lair here and he leads dark and powerful rituals through which the web of reason threatens to tear apart.

In addition to the caves, rivers and deposits, there are various points of interest here:

In the north-west there is a room equipped with a lot of luxury and pomp. This is where Death Tyrannt's dearest undead servant, Patricia Clovus, and leader of his guard lives. She loves to surround herself with the luxurious things of her previous life and desperately at the same time that she can no longer feel them. The warm water stays cold forever and in death every luxury and joy turns into cold and hate.

The next point we have in the east is the transformation chamber in which the flowing river becomes a bloody, evil stream with the help of human sacrifices, magical mushrooms and dark rituals. The water is now charged with terrible energy and flows through various paths to the main room of the Death Tyrannt.

The effects of the magical flow can also be found below. Bloody outgrowths and "plants" grow in the space under the transformation chamber. They move naturally again and thirst for blood.

To the left of the transformation chamber there is another laboratory in which experiments are carried out with the dead and the living. This is where the chimeras and the undead of the Death Tyrant are created. Further to the west there is also the pits in which these beings are kept in a room. Here they also fight against each other and consume their decaying meat.

Even further to the west is the beautiful library of Death Tyrant. Here he does his research and plans his next moves. But be careful! This chamber is only for him and it is guarded with strong magic.

Finally we enter finale the Chamber of the Death Tyrant. The bloody stream converges in the huge basin and discharges its magical power so that the Death Tyrannt can use it. In the lake itself there are countless skeletons that can be resuscitated at any time and then rise round by round out of the bloody stream. In addition, there are magical runes on the floor in this room, which activate various magical traps. We also have some pillars with mirrors mounted on them, which the hovering Death Tyrant can use to shoot his rays at every angle at covered heroes. He himself has an gallery with an summoning circle and other magical mirrors.

If someone should really succeed in overcoming this monster, these heroes can collect their earned money in the treasury of this evil being.
