# The Climb
The party has resolved to scale Mount Stratha and see what is causing all these ghosts to appear.

What will the party encounter on the trek up the mountain? This is supposed to be a pilgrimage for seasoned clerics, but those that have already proven their mettle. The path isn't MEANT to be hazardous. However, now that the party has discovered that waves of ghosts come down from the mountain, I can make that into a sort of environmental hazard.

An avalanche is a usual go-to hazard. An avalanche that attempts to eat you is probably a really interesting hazard, but I'd have to give them something more to work with, like a cave system or some sort of pathway. Sheer cliffs with sporadic outcroppings to be scaled somehow.

Spin whatever hazards you like into encounters with ghost balls or avalanches.
