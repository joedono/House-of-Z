# Dead Marshes
East of Mount Stratha is a large swamp with varying levels of water. There is at least one Grippli village hidden deep in the swamp. Far to the East, but not quite to the coastline, is the lair of Vezdrikex, the Death Tyrant who stole the Spine's necrotic crystal. He's using it to raise an army of undead out of the creatures that live in the swamp. He's had the crystal in his possession for one week by the time the party fights the ghosts in Hazelton.

## Hazards in the Marsh
The marshes are effectively dividied into two areas. The area west of the Grippli village function as a normal swamp with all the normal hazards. Crocodiles, sinkholes, tangling vines, swarms of insects, and other sorts of natural creatures. The region east of the village is under the effects of a Death Tyrant's region as well as the power of the necrotic crystal.

The power of Vezdrikex and the necrotic crystal have caused a sort of undeath plague to eminate out from the eastern edge of the swamp. Every creature that dies in the swamp further east than the Grippli Village is immediately raised as a zombie loyal to Vezdrikex. The plague also gradually rots the flesh of anything living, which is affecting the Grippli. The plague will also effect the players unless they are protected. If asked, Liara will offer them divine charms of protection that accomplish this.

## Grippli Village
The players will start to hear more frog noises mixed in with the natural ambiance of the marshes. The player characters who speak Grippli will recognize words in those noises, saying things like "newcomers", "friend or foe?", "let's wait and see", "watch them". No grippli will appear openly. A DC 20 Perception check will reveal eyes watching from the brush that disappear as soon as they are noticed.

As the party gets close to the village, if they have the protective amulets from Liara, the amulets will start to glow. They are activating and protecting the party from the effects of the necrotic crystal. The Grippli following the party will take notice of this.

-- BOOKMARK --

The village itself is a picture of desperation and despair. It might have seemed nice once, similar to the village in the Seacracker Isles... for frogs. The dwellings are showing mild signs of neglect and disrepair, but the real sign of the despair are the grippli. Every one of them appears to have gaping wounds that don't bleed. Infected or missing eyes, missing flesh on the torso that exposes ribcage, missing limbs, everyone has a chunk of flesh missing from one part or another. Most of the grippli the party will encounter within the village are lucid.

### Thieves in the Night
As the party enters the village, the grippli will have hatched a plan. They truthfully don't know what's happening to them and might beg the party to figure out what's going on, but all they really care about is immediate relief. They will be overly hospitable to the characters and prepare beds for them to rest in. While the party is sleeping, several grippli will attempt to steal the amulets from them. If successful, the grippli will hide the amulets and feign ignorance, seeing it as just another weird circumstance in a village falling under a curse. If they fail, the grippli will beg the party for forgiveness and offer to guide them through the rest of the swamp. The grippli don't know where Vezdrikex's lair is, but they will know how to avoid further combat and hazards farther east of the village (for the most part).

## Eastern Marshes
In addition to the "normal" environmental hazards of the marshes, this area is teaming with the reanimated zombies of various creatures that died in the swamp and were reanimated by the power of the necrotic crystal.
