# Dead Marshes
East of Mount Stratha is a large swamp with varying levels of water. There is at least one Grippli village hidden deep in the swamp. Far to the East, but not quite to the coastline, is the lair of Vezdrikex, the Death Tyrant who stole the Spine's necrotic crystal. He's using it to raise an army of undead out of the creatures that live in the swamp.
