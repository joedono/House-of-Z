# Mountain of the Dead
The party is headed for Mount Stratha, one of the holiest places in Draffnir, the resting place of the Spine of Draffnir, the site for the main Temple of Torm, and home of the party's old adventuring partner, Liara.

The party has been hearing about dead letters being sent around Draffnir. They're all from deceased people and contain imagery of dragons, a giant rising out of the ground, and a war with celestials. The spirits of the deceased are crossing into the Material Plane because the flights of Anguisa the Ghost Dragon are tearing apart the divide. The spirits are congregating in various temples of worship. A very large majority of them are congregating at the temple on Mount Stratha and are in danger of triggering a large-scale disaster.

The powers and defenses of Draffnir's Spine could seal the veil, at least at this location, but they're not working for some reason. The party has to investigate the spirits and find a way to turn on the Spine's defenses.
