# Mountain of the Dead
The party is headed for Mount Stratha, one of the holiest places in Draffnir, the resting place of the Spine of Draffnir, the site for the main Temple of Torm, and home of the party's old adventuring partner, Liara.

The party has been hearing about dead letters being sent around Draffnir. They're all from deceased people and contain imagery of dragons, a giant rising out of the ground, and a war with celestials. The spirits of the deceased are crossing into the Material Plane because the flights of Anguisa the Ghost Dragon are tearing apart the divide. The spirits are congregating in various temples of worship. A very large majority of them are congregating at the temple on Mount Stratha and are in danger of triggering a large-scale disaster.

The powers and defenses of Draffnir's Spine could seal the veil, at least at this location, but they're not working for some reason. The party has to investigate the spirits and find a way to turn on the Spine's defenses.

## Spine's Defenses
Draffnir's Spine protects itself with alternating layers of hallowed ground and desecrated ground. There are very few beings that can pass through both, and it is an unpleasant experience when done. Only "True Neutral" creatures can pass through unharmed, and such creatures are rarely motivated enough to want to harm the Spine at all.

## Current Crisis
The Spine has been put to sleep, and its defenses have switched to nearly entirely hallowed ground, causing the spirits that have been made restless by Anguisa's activities to congregate here in great numbers. By now, the party has received at least one clue that the spirits are attracted to hallow places. If they are left unchecked here, their overpopulation will saturate the Temple of Torm with too much undeath, and threaten to desecrate the temple completely. If that happens, corruption will spread down the mountain and rot a good portion of the continent, possibly including Konith Forest, Bramhold, and Loftran itself.

## Solving the Crisis
The party can re-activate the Spine by waking it up.
