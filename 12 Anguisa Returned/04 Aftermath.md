# Aftermath
The final battle could go either way, and what happens next in the story is heavily dependent on this fight.

## Viserion Resurrects Anguisa
Worst ending. This is basically a TPK, although the temple will resurrect the party after 8 hours. Viserion and Anguisa are now free to wreck havoc in the world. They will resume their plan to assemble the bones of Draffnir and resurrect him as a construct to use as a weapon in the war against the Celestials.

## Viserion Defeats the Party and Anguisa's Vessel is Broken
Anguisa is freed as a Ghost Dragon and has abandoned Viserion, blaming him for her death. Viserion will remain in the temple, lost in his betrayal and grief, while Anguisa resumes her plan to assemble Draffnir alone. She's significantly harder to deal with now, but at least there's only one of her.

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED

## Viserion Defeated and Anguisa's Vessel is Safe
Best ending. The party has defeated Viserion and safely secured Anguisa's Vessel. They now have to decide what to do with it.

One option to continue the story would be to have Garlan the Revenant show up again, steal the vessel, and shatter it in an effort to gain an ally to kill Valmar with.
