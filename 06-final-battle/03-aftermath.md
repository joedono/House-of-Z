# Aftermath
The party has pulled the plug on the ritual to convert the citizens of Loftran. The sigils will stop pumping out transformative energy and gradually shut down. The people with Stage 5 symptoms or lower will gradually return to normal. Anyone higher will likely be driven underground, out of the city, or imprisoned.

## Finding the Royal Family
While emerging from the ritual area, a secret wall will open near the players. This is the door to the royal family's magically warded panic room. When the followers of Zehir started appearing and took over the castle, the king stuffed his family in there for safety. The room is heavily magically warded, so the sigil energy wouldn't have gotten in there. The king himself is no where to be found. His family includes his wife, the queen, two daughters, and a son. The queen will assume leadership and cleanup (so the players don't have to). She'll reward them after she's had time to clean up.

## Exploring the City
This will depend on the time of day. If it's day, there won't be much happening. The players might see some snake-eyed people revert to normal. There might be a few zealots trying to advertise conversion, but they're ignored. As the party watches, city guard will come to shoo them away.

If it's night though, there will be violence everywhere. This time, the side of light is winning though. The party will probably be attacked directly by shadow creatures. They'll be stronger than the default shadows, but weaker than the shadow drakes/snakes the players encountered while rescuing Kellen and within the castle.

## Downtime
The party will have a day of downtime while the queen deals with mopping up the city.

## Reward
The players will be invited to a fantastic party thrown by the queen. They'll be hailed as the saviors of the city. They'll be given a mansion in the inner ring, and one favor from the crown (within reason). That should be interesting.

### Mansion
The mansion used to belong to a noble family named Eloreth, an elven family that recently abandoned their position in the city to pursue ventures in other regions in the world. It was all rather mysterious, actually. Turns out that there will be a secret basement with a dormant portal to the Fey Wild. The place will be dingy, but serviceable. It'll be a lot easier to maintain with staff, but it's unlikely that the party can afford that right now.

On the other hand, when they leave and come back for the first time, the place will have been cleaned by Brownies, which will serve as the first clue to the existence of the portal.

## Bittersweet Celebration
The celebration will be bittersweet though. No one knows where the king has disappeared to. Open future quest for the party.
