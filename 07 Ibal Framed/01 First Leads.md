# First Leads
Fresh out of prison, or fresh off of dealing with the shadow crisis, Ibal resumes his investigation into the murder of Archebald Elmwall and clearing his own name. He has to find the trail again, as spending a week in prison has made it considerably cold.

## Events

### Visitation
During his time in prison, Ibal will be visited by Isabella, Bartel, and Isaac Elmwall. Isabella will make a show of mourning for her husband, and Bartel and Isaac will make threats against Ibal. "I hope they kill you slowly and painfully." and junk like that. Isabella will probably drop a hint about "who's going to manage the vineyard now? I certainly can't do it." and likely drop Makaria's name. The sons might drop Enna or Seebo's names (or neither), hopefully giving the players a few more leads. Use discretion on this, since we don't want to drop too many clues too early. Maybe drop something about their carriage driver being sick.

### Escape
Due to the chaos caused by the initial shadow demon attack and the prison break, Isabella will believe that Ibal has been killed, giving the players a grace period where they won't be harassed while they deal with the shadow crisis. Thread the rest of this plot in as you will.

### Encounter
The players will likely encounter Bartel or Isaac out drinking or in some other situation. They'll recognize Ibal and swear that he'll face justice. They'll make sure every guard in the city knows his face, and being the "savior of the city" won't protect him from their influence for long. Given enough aggravation, they might try to take matters into their own hands, but at least one of them will have to get away to spread the word to Isabella.
