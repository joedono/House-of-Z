## Write Up for Kylah and Sam
Hello! And welcome to the House of Z. Thanks for agreeing to be my guest stars for a little while. Here's a grand info-dump of what you need to know for the session(s).

---

First, introductions. You both know me and Lyndsey, so I'll skip us.

Kylah is Lyndsey's best friend from college.
Sam is Andy's bandmate.
Kyle and Sal are also friends of Lyndsey's from college
Brian and Andrey are fellow convention staffers from Anime Boston.
Andy is Lyndsey's bf.

Second, logistics. Our sessions start at 8pm and go until 10pm on Monday nights. We meet on a three-on-one-off schedule, meaning we meet for three weeks, then take a week off. The session I'd like you both to appear in will be next Monday, August 23rd. I estimate that it will take at least a couple sessions before the party finishes this leg of the adventure, so I'd appreciate it if you both could find time to play the next couple Mondays (the 30th and the 6th) as well. But no pressure.

We use Zoom, Roll20, and DNDBeyond to play. Links are below. Please arrive at the first session at 7:30pm, so we can set you guys up for a surprise reveal before anyone else gets on the call. I'd like you to sign in to the call, change your Zoom display name, turn off your video, and mute yourself until its time for the big reveal. Lyndsey knows that Sam is coming and suspects that Kylah is coming (damn her and her plot predictions!!) and Andy knows that *someone* is coming, but I still want to try to surprise them a little.

Third, the story so far. The campaign is set in a homebrew world. This quest is based on the Book of Cylinders chapter of Candlekeep Mysteries (https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cm/book-of-cylinders), with some tweaks. If you have access to that, you can read that for more details on things. There really isn't any mystery here, so I'm not worried about spoilers.

The party is on a quest to obtain giant crab blood and restore trade between The Heavenly Cay, a grand city of magic and artificer-y, and the Grippli (frog people) village to the south. Both are located within the Seacracker Isles, a massive archipelago. The party stopped at a Grippli Trading Post a few miles away from the village and learned what has happened so far from the Pond Mother, the matriarch of the Grippli people. One month ago, a group of benevolent Yuan-Ti (snake people) arrived at the Grippli village and asked if they could excavate the caved-in basement of the ancient temple near the Grippli Village. They believed there to be artifacts important to their deity, the Scaled Mother, buried beneath the temple. The Pond Mother saw no reason to refuse them, so they began excavating and proved themselves to be friendly and trustworthy allies of the Grippli people.

Two weeks later, a group of evil Yuan-Ti arrived. These immediately subdued any resistance from the Grippli people, imprisoned or killed most of them, and started their own excavation of the temple. The Pond Mother and several Grippli refugees fled to the Grippli Trading Post. These new Yuan-Ti are arrogant and malicious, routinely eating Grippli eggs as snacks. Saving these eggs will probably be your characters' primary goals, so you'll want to get to the Brooding Pools as soon as possible. My Plan A is to have you two be introduced as prisoners inside the Pond Mother's home and main gathering hall for the village. You'll be imprisoned along with some of the good Yuan-Ti.

The party has just successfully navigated the Crab Maze, a maze of rope bridges and docks surrounding the giant crab breeding nets. The crabs hadn't been fed in two weeks, so that was a harrowing trip. They passed over the breakwater that separates the main docks of the village from the maze and the rivers beyond and are now entering the village. They haven't been discovered by the evil Yuan-Ti patrols ....yet

Fourth, your characters. Since you'll know each other, here's a summary. Feel free to embellish or correct anything you like.

Sam is playing Splurgl the Patient, a Grippli monk. He's an expert fisher and crab breeder, known around the village for making hearty fish stews and playing pleasant tunes on his dad's banjo. Looks like a salty old schmuck, but is actually pretty pleasant. His skill as a fighter made the evil Yuan-Ti especially wary of him. He managed to dispatch a few of them before being overwhelmed. He'll start comically tied up in the prison cell, to the point that you see more rope than frog when you look at him.

Kylah is playing Amelia Vandervelde, a Kalashtar artificer. She is a scholar with a focus on studying linguistics and lost civilizations. Studying the Grippli is her fourth field mission, but the first that she's undertaken by herself, so she's still a little green. She's not much of a direct fighter, but has great arcane skill. She arrived around the same time as the good Yuan-Ti, and has been helping with the excavation efforts. She believes in leaving discoveries where they lie, in the proper hands, and only takes notes and draws (bad) pictures of what she finds for later study.

Finally, your contribution to the overall plot. Whether this comes up or not is up to the narrative and player choice. Amelia has a semi-ulterior motive in investigating the Grippli Temple. She wants to find out why the Grippli abandoned the temple around 3 months ago and moved to the village. The Pond Mother told you that it was to be closer to the giant crab breeding cages and the coast. Splurgl and the other Grippli told you "it just didn't feel like 'home' anymore." As a Kaleshtar, a race with strong empathy and experience with things that can influence dreams and subconscious motivations, you suspect that there really might be something buried beneath the temple. Something that might have been influencing those on the surface with a subconscious desire to settle in and protect the area. Something that suddenly stopped working around 3 months ago for some reason.
