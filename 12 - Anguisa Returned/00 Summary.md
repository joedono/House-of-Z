# Summary
The party has discovered the location of the hidden Temple of Torm and are now suspicious of the Torm clerics in Durrstaft. Their likely suspects will be those with green eyes, which are Shani Longspotter and Marloth Sethran. The things that implicate Shani are her pet cat, Pads, and the lost spellbook she has in her chambers. Her cat is actually King Samuel of Loftran. Simply dealing 1HP damage to Pads will undo the True Polymorph spell he's been put under. If Liara can get a look at the spellbook, she'll recognize it as the book her order on Mount Stratha had lost.

## Party Goal
The party's goal is to somehow stop Viserion from resurrecting Anguisa. There are a number of ways they can do this:

1. Outright defeat of Viserion
2. Discover and destroy Anguisa's Skull
    * Currently hidden in a cave along the north pass of Durrstaft
3. Discover and steal Anguisa's Soul container
    * Currently being used as a lantern in Shani's dorm room
    * If comfronted and not yet exposed, Shani will claim it is a divinely charged stone she wanted Nathan's help identifying. An obvious lie.
    * If they destroy it, Anguisa's Soul will be released into the world as a Ghost Dragon

4. Discover and steal the Spiritwell Flower
    * Currently planted on the north shore, near the port that takes ships to Lindenvale
    * This isn't actually needed for the Resurrection
    * Stealing this will significantly delay Viserion and Anguisa's plan to reconstitute Draffnir
5. Steal the Torm Spellbook
    * Currently in Shani's satchel
6. Expose Viserion's dragon nature to the guards of Durrstaft
7. Restore King Samuel and have him call for martial aid, leading to Viserion's exposure
