# Summary
The party has discovered the location of the hidden Temple of Torm and are now suspicious of the Torm clerics in Durrstaft. Their likely suspects will be those with green eyes, which are Shani Longspotter and Marloth Sethran. The things that implicate Shani are her pet cat, Pads, and the lost spellbook she has in her chambers. Her cat is actually King Samuel of Loftran. Simply dealing 1HP damage to Pads will undo the True Polymorph spell he's been put under. If Liara can get a look at the spellbook, she'll recognize it as the book her order on Mount Stratha had lost.

The thing that implicates Marloth is that three weeks ago, she left the city by the south gate and traveled alone to Loftran. The players might be suspicious that she got past the Snow Mutant without being harassed and killed. Marloth is actually a fairly powerful cleric who can take care of herself just fine.

## Party Goal
The party's goal is to somehow stop Viserion from resurrecting Anguisa. There are a number of ways they can do this:

1. Outright defeat of Viserion
2. Discover and destroy Anguisa's Skull
    * Currently hidden in a cave along the north pass of Durrstaft
3. Discover and steal Anguisa's Soul container
    * Currently being used as a lantern in Shani's dorm room
    * If confronted and not yet exposed, Shani will claim it is a divinely charged stone she wanted Nathan's help identifying. An obvious lie.
    * If they destroy it, Anguisa's Soul will be released into the world as a Ghost Dragon

4. Discover and steal the Spiritwell Flower
    * Currently planted on the north shore, near the port that takes ships to Lindenvale
    * This isn't actually needed for the Resurrection
    * Stealing this will significantly delay Viserion and Anguisa's plan to reconstitute Draffnir
5. Steal the Torm Spellbook
    * Currently in Shani's satchel
6. Expose Viserion's dragon nature to the guards of Durrstaft
7. Restore King Samuel and have him call for martial aid, leading to Viserion's exposure
8. Get to the Torm Temple and warn whoever is there that Viserion is coming

## Hidden Torm Temple
Only Nathan really knows all the secrets of the hidden temple. Alistor only knows that there is an underground entrance to something in the Durrstaft Mountains that is protected by strong divine magic. He knows enough to tell the players how to get there, but doesn't know anything about how to get in.

Viserion will use Detect Thoughts repeatedly on Master Nathan to extract the location of the temple from him.
