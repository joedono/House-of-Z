# Back to the Temple
With Alistor's warning not to trust all the clerics of Torm, it's possible that the party will want to head back there and attempt to out one of them as Viserion. Their primary method of identifying him will be the Lantern of Tracking (Dragons), Theryn's Primeval Awareness (if he remembers that he has it), and the fact that Viserion always has green eyes when he transforms.

They might also suspect that Viserion has the King Samuel of Loftran as a prisoner somehow.

## Suspects
The lantern and the awareness will both reveal that there is indeed a dragon in the temple. Of all the clerics at the temple, the two that have green eyes are Shani Longspotter and Marloth Sethran.

### Marloth
The thing that implicates Marloth is that three weeks ago, she left the city by the south gate and traveled alone to Loftran. The players might be suspicious that she got past the Snow Mutant without being harassed and killed. Marloth is actually a fairly powerful cleric who can take care of herself just fine.

### Shani
Shani is really Viserion in disguise.

Her cat, Pads, is King Samuel under the effect of a freshly cast True Polymorph spell. Dealing 1HP of damage to Pads will undo the spell and revert him to King Samuel.

As of yet undiscovered by the players, Shani has in her satchel Liara's clan's lost tome of prayers and spells. It's what he's been using to cast True Polymorph and how he hopes to cast True Resurrection to bring back Anguisa once all the ingredients are in place. If the party searches her belongings and Valmar gets a look at the book, Liara will recognize it.

In Shani's dorm room is a large lamp. If the party inspects it, they'll find Anguisa's spirit vessel. It's protected by a Glyph of Warding spell. If the stone or the lamp it is attached to are moved, it'll trigger the Explosive Runes.

## Party Return
When the party returns to the Durrstaft, Marloth will be performing a service in the main area of the temple.
