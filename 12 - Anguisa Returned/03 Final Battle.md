# Final Battle
Midway through the final battle with the Proginator Werewolf, Viserion will enter the chamber of the final challenge. The various characters in the challenge will stop fighting the players and a divine light will engulf the players, granting them a LEVEL UP to level 8 and the benefits of a long rest.

The ghost of the hag will appear and resurrect itself. She, the proginator werewolf, and the wolf "children" will explain the situation to the players and petition their aid to deal with the threat before running off to battle.

The NPCs can do battle, but will require the players' will to direct their actions. Maybe grant each player control over one of the NPCs. So you'll need the hag, the werewolf, plus 4 other NPCs. Maybe use the wolf children or the moss beasts that were protecting the hag's hut. Rotate control every initiative.

Use the same battle map for the village from the challenge for the final battle. It should have some interesting landscapes and houses for the players to hide in.

## Viserion Tactics
-- BOOKMARK --
The site that Viserion is searching for is in the center of the "town". He'll have the Anguisa's vessel and the Torm Spellbook in a pack, and her skull strapped with rope to his back (a load that should obviously be too much for his slender body). He'll have the form of Nathan Sarnol, the master cleric from Durrstaft, except with piercing green eyes, per usual.

If left undisturbed, Viserion will set down the ingredients in the center of town and begin the ritual
* Carve a circle into the dirt in the center of town
* Place the skull inside the circle
* Place the vessel inside the skull
* Read the True Resurrection spell from the Torm Spellbook

The True Resurrection spell normally takes 1 hour to cast. Having the skull cuts that time down to 30 minutes.

### Player-Relevant Info
* The skull has an AC of 10 and 100hp
* Stealing the Torm Spellbook and fleeing will prevent the ritual
* Stealing the vessel without destroying it will prevent the ritual
* The NPCs are immune to Viserion's Frightful Presence

## During the Battle
Viserion is an Ancient Black Dragon - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ancient-black-dragon

Upon being attacked, Viserion will stash the vessel and spellbook into his pack, place it within the ritual circle, and then assume his dragon form by stabbing himself and dispelling the True Polymorph spell. He'll work to protect the ritual site.

During the battle, a DC 18 Perception check will reveal Pads, Shani's cat and actually King Samuel of Loftran, lurking around the battlefield.

If Viserion still has access to Anguisa's vessel when he reaches half HP, he'll talk about how he wished to bring Anguisa back to her body immediately, but this will have to do, and he'll destroy the vessel (and possibly the skull). This will cause Anguisa to emerge as a Ghost Dragon - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ghost-dragon.

If Anguisa's vessel is destroyed (by any means), she'll emerge as a Ghost Dragon, elated with her freedom. But then she'll reveal that she blames Viserion for her death. She thinks he abandoned her when she was lured into the hidden temple, and plans to do the same thing to him. She then flees through the ceiling, leaving Viserion shattered and insane with rage. He'll abandon all tactics and resume attacking the party.

A successful DC 21 Persuasion check could calm him down and he'll sink into despair.
