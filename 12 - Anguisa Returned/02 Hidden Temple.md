# Hidden Temple
If the party comes straight here after leaving Alistor, they'll know the temple's location and a little about the traps and devices that are waiting for them. Their goal will be to locate the site of Anguisa's defeat, which is inside the temple itself.

The clerics and Deathbringers discovered at least part of what Anguisa was planning to do, what sort of ritual she intended to cast. They started spreading a rumor that one of her required ritual components was located in the hidden temple to lure Anguisa into a place where the clerics would have the lair advantage. Through creative use of the divine magic and devices within the temple, the clerics and Deathbringers defeated Anguisa.

If the party comes here after returning to the Temple of Torm, Nathan will have armed them with a talisman that will get them past the initial entrance and some of the traps, and warned them about some of the other tests and devices they will encounter. We're channeling Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade here.
