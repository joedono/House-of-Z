# Hidden Temple
If the party comes straight here after leaving Alistor, they'll know the temple's location and a little about the traps and devices that are waiting for them. Their goal will be to locate the site of Anguisa's defeat, which is inside the temple itself.

The clerics and Deathbringers discovered at least part of what Anguisa was planning to do, what sort of ritual she intended to cast. They started spreading a rumor that one of her required ritual components was located in the hidden temple to lure Anguisa into a place where the clerics would have the lair advantage. Through creative use of the divine magic and devices within the temple, the clerics and Deathbringers defeated Anguisa.

If the party comes here after returning to the Temple of Torm, Nathan will have armed them with a talisman that will get them past the initial entrance and some of the traps, and warned them about some of the other tests and devices they will encounter. We're channeling Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade here.

Time will fluctuate inside the temple, leaving the party with plenty of opportunities for long rests.

## Tenets
1. The first tenant is selflessness. You must be willing to give of yourself to protect others
2. The second tenant is focus. You must find something precious to protect. It could be a loved one or it could be the world, but it must not violate the first tenant.
3. The third tenant is drive. You must be willing to give your everything to protect your focus.
4. The fourth tenant is sacrifice. You must be willing to lose everything and still protect your focus.
5. The final tenant is self. Even if you lose everything, the one thing that must be protected above all else is yourself.

## Temple Entrance
The temple entrance is a cave that leads to a short tunnel. At the end of the tunnel is a carving into the stone. It is four pictograms:
1. A bloody knight holding his shield in front of a smaller figure
2. The knight kneeling in front of the smaller figure
3. The knight training while the smaller figure watches
4. The knight bloody on the ground while the smaller figure kneels nearby

5. The knight brandishing his sword and shield to protect a group of smaller figures from a large figure wearing the same clothes as the small figure from the previous murals

Along with the words *Name the Tenats* carved above them.

Simply reciting the first four tenats of Torm (selflessness, focus, drive, sacrifice) out loud will unlock the gate, causing the stone to move aside and revealing the continuing tunnel. If the party doesn't remember the tenats, then a DC 20 Religion check will have them remember.

## Challenges Within
The hazards within the temple are a gauntlet of challenges meant to test the mettle and worthiness of clerics who want to devote themselves to Torm. The hazards will be themed after each of the first four tenats: selflessness, focus, drive, and sacrifice. How do I turn those into hazards that directly test each tenant?

The party will be given the chance to take a short rest after each of the first 4 challenges, and a long rest before the Final Challenge via time-bending chambers.

### Selflessness
This is basic protection, done through a combat encounter. There will be a Hatching Stone that a couple waves of constructs will attempt to attack. The cleric will have to protect the stone by defeating the approaching enemies.

Stone Golem (Reduced Threat) - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/reduced-threat-stone-golem
Roper - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/roper

The golems will approach the crystal from many directions, casting Slow on party members before approaching the crystal. The multi-directional attack should keep the party off-balance. The ropers will attempt to pull party members away from the crystal. The challenge ends when the party has defeated a certain number of creatures.

If the party has the talisman from Nathan, the chamber will not activate and the door to the next chamber will open.

### Focus and Drive
This test will put the cleric in a position to protect something or someone they value or care about, done through a puzzle challenge. Since Liara is going to be the temple's target, the obvious focus for this test will be Ibal, so he'll be separated from the party at some point.

He'll be separated from the party by a moving wall, and be forced to take a separate passage. The party will meet up again in another room, with Ibal separated from the rest of the group by a wide and deep chasm. His path will end, but the party's will continue. On the party's path is a series of buttons in the floor. When pressed in specific combinations, platforms will come out of the wall on Ibal's side, allowing him to gradually make his way across the chasm. The party will have to coordinate and figure out which buttons to press in what order.

Stepping on a button will extend the connected platforms. Stepping off the button will retract the platforms. Stepping on another button will extend connected platforms, unless that platform is already extended, in which case it will retract that platform.

If the platform that Ibal is standing on retracts, he can make a Dex Save to try and grab a nearby extended platforms.
* If the platform is right next to him, the DC is 15
* If the platform is 5 feet away, the DC is 17
* If the platform is 10 feet away, the DC is 20.

### Sacrifice
This test will test the cleric's willingness to let things go in order to protect. Pitting them against controlled Allips will force their allies to attach each other. This will be another combat encounter.

Allip - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/allip. Good choice for ability to make allies attack each other.

If the party has the talisman from Nathan, the chamber will not activate and the door to the next chamber will open.

## Final Challenge - Self
The final challenge will be a lesson in "not everything **SHOULD** be protected" and actually contain everything from the module The Curse of Wardenwood.

The party finds the final door. Above the door is carved the word *SELF*. Beyond the door is a lush forest. The environment is completely out of place, since the party is underground. The ceiling is so high that it appears to be just darkness at night. There is even a slight wind blowing through the leaves. After walking through the forest for a short while, the party discovers Drusilla's Hut, kicking off the adventure.

We had a couple yellow-lights on the consent checklist for "Harm to Children", so maybe change the werewolf children to make them adults.

-- BOOKMARK --
The group has alerted Drusilla that they don't trust her and combat is beginning.

## Actual Challenge
Of course, the party isn't actually here to overcome the challenges. They're here to stop Viserion. All they really have to do is choose their battleground. The Final Challenge will probably be ideal, since a Weld Hag and a Proginator Werewolf will prove valuable allies in the fight against Viserion.

Viserion's goal will be the site of Anguisa's defeat, which was in the large Final Challenge chamber.
