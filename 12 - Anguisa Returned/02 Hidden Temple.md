# Hidden Temple
If the party comes straight here after leaving Alistor, they'll know the temple's location and a little about the traps and devices that are waiting for them. Their goal will be to locate the site of Anguisa's defeat, which is inside the temple itself.

The clerics and Deathbringers discovered at least part of what Anguisa was planning to do, what sort of ritual she intended to cast. They started spreading a rumor that one of her required ritual components was located in the hidden temple to lure Anguisa into a place where the clerics would have the lair advantage. Through creative use of the divine magic and devices within the temple, the clerics and Deathbringers defeated Anguisa.

If the party comes here after returning to the Temple of Torm, Nathan will have armed them with a talisman that will get them past the initial entrance and some of the traps, and warned them about some of the other tests and devices they will encounter. We're channeling Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade here.

Time will fluctuate inside the temple, leaving the party with plenty of opportunities for long rests.

## Tenants
1. The first tenant is selflessness. You must be willing to give of yourself to protect others
2. The second tenant is focus. You must find something precious to protect. It could be a loved one or it could be the world, but it must not violate the first tenant.
3. The third tenant is drive. You must be willing to give your everything to protect your focus.
4. The fourth tenant is sacrifice. You must be willing to lose everything to protect your focus.
5. The final tenant is self. Even if you lose everything, the one thing that must be protected above all else is yourself.

## Temple Entrance
The temple entrance is a cave that leads to a short tunnel. At the end of the tunnel is a carving into the stone. It is four pictograms:
1. A bloody knight holding his shield in front of a smaller figure
2. The knight kneeling in front of the smaller figure
3. The knight training while the smaller figure watches
4. The knight bloody on the ground while the smaller figure kneels nearby

along with the words *Name the Tenants* carved above them.

Simply reciting the first four tenants of Torm (selflessness, focus, drive, sacrifice) out loud will unlock the gate, causing the stone to move aside and revealing the continuing tunnel

## Hazards Within
The hazards within the temple are a gauntlet of challenges meant to test the mettle and worthiness of clerics who want to devote themselves to Torm.

## Final Challenge
The final challenge will be a lesson in "not everything SHOULD be protected" and actually contain everything from the module The Curse of Wardenwood.

The party finds the final door. Above the door is carved the word *SELF*. Beyond the door is a lush forest. The environment is completely out of place, since the party is underground. The ceiling is so high that it appears to be just darkness at night. There is even a slight wind blowing through the leaves. After walking through the forest for a short while, the party discovers Drusilla's Hut, kicking off the adventure.

We had a couple yellow-lights on the consent checklist for "Harm to Children", so maybe change the werewolf children to make them adults.
