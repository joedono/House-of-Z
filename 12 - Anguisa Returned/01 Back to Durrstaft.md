# Back to the Temple
With Alistor's warning not to trust all the clerics of Torm, it's possible that the party will want to head back there and attempt to out one of them as Viserion. Their primary method of identifying him will be the Lantern of Tracking (Dragons), Theryn's Primeval Awareness (if he remembers that he has it), and the fact that Viserion always has green eyes when he transforms.

They might also suspect that Viserion has the King Samuel of Loftran as a prisoner somehow.

## Suspects
The lantern and the awareness will both reveal that there is indeed a dragon in the temple. Of all the clerics at the temple, the two that have green eyes are Shani Longspotter and Marloth Sethran.

### Marloth
The thing that implicates Marloth is that three weeks ago, she left the city by the south gate and traveled alone to Loftran. The players might be suspicious that she got past the Snow Mutant without being harassed and killed. Marloth is actually a fairly powerful cleric who can take care of herself just fine.

### Shani
Shani is really Viserion in disguise.

Her cat, Pads, is King Samuel under the effect of a freshly cast True Polymorph spell. Dealing 1HP of damage to Pads will undo the spell and revert him to King Samuel.

As of yet undiscovered by the players, Shani has in her satchel Liara's clan's lost tome of prayers and spells. It's what he's been using to cast True Polymorph and how he hopes to cast True Resurrection to bring back Anguisa once all the ingredients are in place. If the party searches her belongings and Valmar gets a look at the book, Liara will recognize it.

In Shani's dorm room is a large lamp. If the party inspects it, they'll find Anguisa's spirit vessel. It's protected by a Glyph of Warding spell. If the stone or the lamp it is attached to are moved, it'll trigger the Explosive Runes.

## Party Return
When the party returns to the Durrstaft, Marloth will be performing a service in the main area of the temple. The service only has a few minutes left. If the party wants to wait, they can interrogate Marloth about her recent activities. She might bring up knowing about the dangers on the road south off-handedly, or her journey south to Loftran.

Eberk, Travok, and Harbek are serving as assistants or altar boys for the service. When it's over, they'll immediately run off to some mischief or another before Marloth scolds them about leaving all the cleanup work to her.

Gunnolda will be cooking whatever meal is next in the day (probably lunch or dinner). She'll ask the party where Alistor is, saying that he told her that he'd be going out with them on "personal business" this morning. Gunnolda will press the party a little and may become angry at their answers. If the party reveals Alistor's true nature as a silver dragon, she'll react with disbelief and that she doesn't appreciate jokes.

Jarrek will be helping Gunnolda in the kitchen.

Pads will be milling about in the kitchen, looking for snacks. This will give the party an opportunity to capture him and see what they can do about the True Polymorph spell, assuming they even suspect it. He won't go willingly, sparking a skill challenge to chase him around the temple.

Shani and Nathan will be upstairs in his office discussing how donations and attendees have been going down lately. Nathan will suspect that the clerics of Eldath are effectively "poaching" members of the Temple of Torm. Shani will be sympathetic and suggest childish ideas, like a bake sale or making toys for children. Nathan will be dismissive. Throughout the conversation, Shani/Viserion will be casting Detect Thoughts and asking questions about the hidden temple in an effort to deduce its location. Nathan won't be able to detect that he's being probed.

## Confrontation
Through one method or another, the party is likely to come into conflict with Viserion right here. Shani will discover the party capturing Pads, snooping around her room, or accusing her directly.

If the party has discovered Pads or Anguisa's Vessel, Shani will plead that the party return her beloved belongings. If the party insists on pressing the matter, Shani will reveal the ancient Torm spellbook and cast Meteor Swarm to disable everyone. If an honest fight ensues, Shani's objective will be to disable the party and get away. She'll have learned of the location of the hidden temple and set off for there.

## Nathan's Help
If a fight ensues and Viserion gets away, the clerics of Torm will be able to get the party back on their feet. Nathan will know that Viserion wants to get into the final chamber of the hidden temple and that he was able to extract enough information from Detect Thoughts to learn where the temple is and how to get past at least some of its defenses. Nathan will be entirely willing to help the party this time. He'll give the party the location of the temple, and a divine talisman that will get them through the initial locks. He'll warn that there are at least a few tests of mettle in the temple that he can't help with, but he will send the party off with a Heroes' Feast https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/heroes-feast to improve their chances of surviving.

He'll also know that there are no living people at the temple. It is a sight of pilgrimage and proving, nothing more. However, he'll also see the benefit of attempting to use the temple's traps against Viserion. Viserion will have to retrieve Anguisa's Skull from wherever he hid it (Currently hidden in a cave along the north pass of Durrstaft), so if the party leaves now, there's still a chance they could beat him to the temple.
