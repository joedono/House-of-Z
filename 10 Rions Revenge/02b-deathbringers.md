# Deathbringers
The party received a letter of recommendation from Victor and Naomi Brisly after assisting them with the ghost of Eliza Long. They were instructed to seek out a tiefling named Hope in the Heavenly Cay if they wished to pursue membership.

The Deathbringer HQ is located in The Gilded Circle, the south-eastern district of The Heavenly Cay. Hope will make herself known soon after the party inquires about her. The headquarters isn't really a secret, but it presents itself as a mercenary industry rather than an order devoted to destroying undead. There's a good chance someone here will have heard about Anguisa's release and have a hunting party out looking for clues.

The Deathbringers operate behind the mercenary guild known as Gilded Shield.

## Anguisa
A previous generation of Deathbringers took part in the ritual to seal Anguisa after she was defeated. Hope has heard news of her escape but doesn't know that she's living rent-free in Valmar's head. Hope will be very keen to know the results of Adran's extraction procedure and will have a squadron ready when the party returns to the Cay after saving the Grippli to take the sealed soul of Anguisa to a secure location.

Of course, no one knows that Viserion is in the city and will actually take part in the procedure. A fight may ensue.

## The List
If the party presents their list of locations from the hidden garden, Hope will put it together that it contains the ingredients necessary to resurrect Anguisa. It also contains many references to the bones of Draffnir. Hope will not be able to infer anything from that, nor will she have any idea what's in the Abyss that would be relevant to this list.
