# The Extraction
With the treated crab's blood ready for the procedure, Adran is ready to begin.

## Blood Extraction Procedure
A special procedure for extracting specific "essences" from a body. Simply trying to draw out the blood or arcane energies will result in simple blood/energy being extracted.

1. Use scanning equipment to get an imprint of the target "essence"
2. Use the imprint to treat the giant crab blood so that it will bind to the target "essence" and make it susceptible to freezing
3. Inject the patient with the treated giant crab blood
4. Scan the patient for the binding agent
5. Once located, freeze the "essence" with a specialized arcane laser
6. Draw out the essence with a syringe for bodily fluids, or a crystal siphon for arcane or spiritual energies, into a suitable vessel

BUT FIRST, the crab's blood has to be treated. The process will take three days, giving the party time to roam the city a little.

## Viserion and King Samuel
Viserion has brought King Samuel here because he needs to learn the "essence extraction" procedure from Adran Galonodel in order to extract Samuel's "Blood of the Giants". Because the Blood of the Giants is an integral part of who King Samuel is, the process will render him completely catatonic forever.

So, Viserion has assumed the guise of a clumsy halfing named Rion Blackspice, and has entrenched himself as Adran's newest apprentice. Rion is secretly working on a plan to gain access to the advanced medical equipment necessary to perform the extraction procedure on King Samuel, who is under the effect of a True Polymorph spell, and is now in the form of Rion's lizard familiar, Fangs. Failing that, at least witness the process in action so he can attempt to recreate it after being reunited with Anguisa. Viserion is also monitoring the efforts of some Yuan-Ti minions leftover from Loftran to excavate the Giant Finger Bones located beneath the Grippli temple to the south. Rion is also in possession of Liara's clan's advanced spellbook. The book contains a selection of 9th level spells, including True Resurrection, which Viserion needs in order to bring Anguisa back to life, and the True Polymorph spell that transformed King Samuel into the lizard, Fangs.

Now that Rion has located Anguisa, he will steal the vessel containing her soul at the first opportunity, killing Adran if he has to, and flee the city back East.

## Next Steps
Viserion's objective is to bring Anguisa's Soul back to the site of Anguisa's death to have the greatest chance of bringing her back. Adran will know this, but not the location. The party can also make Arcana or Religion checks to remember how True Resurrection works (in this world). It can work anywhere, but you need to make a spellcasting check for it to work anywhere other than where the target died.

Hope of the Deathbringers will have on file that Anguisa's defeat took place near Durrstaft in an ancient temple dedicated to Torm. The clerics channeled the strong divinity of the temple to trap Anguisa's soul and seal it in the vessel. The temple has long been a site of pilgrimage for clerics and paladins from Durrstaft, so it is likely that Viserion will have to fight and kill to gain access to the inner temple.

Of course, the military of Durrstaft will notice Viserion approaching, so he'll cast True Polymorph on himself and hide in the mountains while scouring the records in Durrstaft to find out where the temple is and amass enough supplies for an expedition out into the snowy mountains.

## Level Up
As soon as the party leaves The Heavenly Cay, they can become level 7.
