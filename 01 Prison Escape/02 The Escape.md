# The Escape
Malcom dies on the floor of the prison, his key ring clatters across the floor to within range of one of the players' cells, providing the players with a way to get out and possibly let each other out. Now they must escape the prison and find a place of safety. The section of the city they're in has been overrun by Shadow creatures, and the players must find someplace that still has light going, or move to a section of the city that hasn't been overrun.

## NPCs

### Eldon
Male Halfling (former?) Prisoner. Was thrown in jail the same day as Ibal (5 days ago) for stealing from a noble who was out to market. Plans on escaping and finding his younger brother, who managed to get away during the thieving scheme.


## Events

### Dark Passenger
Once at least half of the players are freed from their cells, the creature that killed Malcom reveals itself by rising out of a dark pool of shadow from under Malcom's body. It is a Shadow, and it shies away from the few torches on the walls of the prison...at first. But eventually, the torches glow a soft green before they are snuffed out by magic. The Shadow grows more bold and leaps into the attack.

Encounter - Shadow x1 (with two more waiting elsewhere in the prison)

### Malcom's Corpse
Malcom's body can provide a little bit of information to the players. His gut has three long slashes across it. Blood has poured out but quickly ceases after his death. A DC 15 Medicine check will reveal that a couple of his organs are missing, his liver and his heart. A DC 12 Investigation check will reveal that Malcom had 5gp in his pockets, and a beautiful silver wedding band on his finger with the letters "M&E" carved into it.

### Gear Retrieval
The players' gear is in the main guard room to the north, along with the guards' supplies, a few sets of leather armor, some shortswords, one shortbow with a quiver of 20 arrows. A DC 12 Investigation check will turn up 20gp among the supplies.

### Ambush
As the players are retrieving their gear or making their escape, two more Shadows will emerge and attack them. The players can either flee outside or stay and fight them.

Encounter - Shadow x3
Map - 1-Hanging-Noose-Prison

### A Clue in the Last Breath
After the players escape the prison, they come across the still-breathing body of Gorma, lying on the ground in a pool of blood. Her half-orc resilience enabled her to live a little longer despite her injuries, which are identical to Malcom's. She has several large parallel gashes across her abdomen. Another DC 15 Medicine check will reveal that she's also missing her liver and stomach. Before she dies, she whispers to the players, "They're afraid....of light. Head for the House of Sunlight (the church) to the North-East." At about that time, the players will hear the sound of magical energy discharge, and there will be a green pillar of light nearby, followed by the hissing of Shadows and screaming people. If the players hang around too long, another Shadow will appear out of Gorma's shadow and attack them.

### Disappearing into the Night
If Eldon survives through the prison escape, the players can attempt a DC 20 Persuasion check to convince him to stay with them. Otherwise, he'll take off into the night to search for his brother. Depending on whether I feel like the players are developing a relationship with him, I might have him show up at the church, with or without his brother in tow.
