# The Deep Floor
The party is outfitted with aether filtration suits and Engineers Avery and Abel Halverstone are hard at work fixing the lift down to the Deep Floor. The party has been tasked with a couple things in addition to finding the Large Hatching Stone.
1. Find and retrieve Abel Halverstone's stone-finder device. Keth Clast has this on his person.
2. Find and retrieve a "magical shiny stone" for Quartermaster Heath Levenworth. The players will know this when they see it. He wants one of the Beads of Force found scattered around the mines.

The players descend down into the depths of the mines, where the miners themselves dare not tread. The way was abandoned two months ago when the lift malfunctioned and killed a dozen miners...or so the players are lead to believe. The players must explore the Deep Floor in search of a large raw Hatching Stone, and survive the hazards lurking there.

## Introduction
As the players exit the lift (or finish rappelling down), they would be expecting a dark mine with no light sources. What they see instead is a great crystal cave. The walls have yellow-white veins of Hatching Stone material running through them. They pulse with light to a regular rhythm, and flood the area with light. The light dims to near darkness every few seconds, only to surge back again, illuminating the corridors.

## Aether Poisoning
Quartermaster Heath warned the players of aether poisoning by showing them his own crystal scaling. Each player is equipped with a filtration suit. If any of the players suits becomes compromised, they begin to suffer from aether poisoning. Have the players make a DC 13 CON save periodically to resist the effects. Failure advances the symptoms one stage.

Valmer, Liara, and Ardin are mostly unaffected, having bodies that are attuned to channeling aether, and thus get advantage on the checks. If the party is level 3, Theryn will know enough magic to also gain advantage on the check. Fran and Ibal make the rolls normally.

Stages 1-5 and 7 can be cured by a cleric. Symptoms 6 and 8 are permanent. Symptoms 9 and 10 constitute the death of the character.

Stages:
1. Light itching on the exposed skin
2. Periodic "shinies" in vision, caused by small crystals forming and dissolving in the eyes.
3. Loss of feeling in extremities (disadvantage on fine motor skill checks)
4. Painful stabbing sensation just below the skin (1 damage per turn of combat or 1d4 damage per hour of non-combat)
5. Brain fog (disadvantage on WIS, INT, and CHA skill checks and concentration checks)
6. Crystal scaling (+1 AC)
7. Paranoia
8. Crystallization of limbs (half movement speed, -2 to attack rolls)
9. Crystallization of brain (surrender control of character to DM, point of no return)
10. Crystallization of heart (character death)

## NPCs

### Keth Clast
A survivor of the lift disaster three months ago, and Foreman Clast's brother (half-orc). He has managed to survive down here due to his ingenuity and determination. He has managed to keep his filtration suit functioning by patching it with scraps from the other miners and adventurers who were stranded down here with him. Despite that, he is showing signs of Stage 7 Aether Poisoning. He's been surviving on rations and the meat of the creatures down here, which of course causes his aether poisoning to get worse. He'll have a noticeable bulge on the back of his head, but the filtration suit will prevent the players from seeing what it is. Of course, it's a crystal growth on the back of his skull.

He's holed up in the NE corner of the map. The path leading to his lair is strewn with rope, making up a makeshift alarm system with rudimentary traps. The party can make Acrobatics or Stealth checks to get through (or just burn everything). When they encounter Keth this way, he'll attack them, as he believes that everything down here is hostile. If the party can calm him down or otherwise break through his paranoia, he can be a valuable ally, assuming they don't kill him. His stash has the main source of loot below.

If the party elects to go South or West, they'll encounter monsters. Keth will follow them and intervene at a critical moment in the fight. If the party doesn't need help, then they'll notice him and he'll flee, triggering the above paragraph, but with far less hostility.

## Events

### Arrival
The mines are very well lit due to the pulsing hatching stone material in the walls. Every few seconds, the light will dim and plunge the area into pitch darkness, only to relight a few seconds later. Almost like the mines have a heartbeat. Unfortunately, this will likely give some of the monsters down here the advantage in ambushing the players.

### Finding the Previous Squad
The party will find broken equipment scattered on the floor of the mines. This is the remaining equipment from the miners who were stranded down here. There's nothing useful in the rubble. All of the useful stuff has been scavenged by Keth. If the party explores the western tunnel, they'll encounter several Crystal Zombies, the surviving miners who have succumbed to their aether poisoning.

### Helping Hand
If the party explores the Western or Southern tunnels before the Eastern one, they'll run into their second fight. During the fight, Keth will make an appearance and aid the players. He'll be friendly if met this way. If the party reveals that the lift is fixed, he'll be ecstatic and ask for the party's help in gathering up his gear from his hovel in the eastern tunnel. The party is free to take a short rest while they're here.

### Hostile Survivor
If the party explores the Eastern tunnel first, they'll encounter a maze of trip ropes linked to small cave-ins and crude alarm systems. They have found the path to Keth's hovel. However they encounter Keth at this point, whether by surprise or not, Keth will be hostile and attack the party, but he'll demonstrate lucidity. He'll claim that they are "just more monsters" and that they're invading his home. A bit of fighting and maybe a Persuasion check will convince Keth that the party aren't monsters. See above for Keth's reactions to the lift being fixed.

### Finding the Large Hatching Stone
The only Large Hatching Stone fit for retrieval is located in the southern tunnel. Unfortunately, a couple of Giant Crystal Spiders have made their nest there and will attack the party once they approach the stone.

### Pursued
Once the party removes the stone, they'll hear a loud roar echo from the south-western chamber. They have awoken the Crystal Guardian, once a stout adventurer assigned to guard the last group of miners and a powerful enemy. Keth will react with extreme fear and try to convince the party to grab the stone and run for the lift. They don't stand a chance against the guardian, which will chase them back to the lift.

The party will encounter another group of Crystal Ambush Drakes during their escape. As a first strike for the encounter, Keth will take a hit for someone else. The crystal laser will hit him in the head and vaporize his filtration suit and mask, likely leading to him suffering from Stage 7 or 8 aether poisoning.

If necessary, Keth will sacrifice himself to delay the Guardian long enough for the party to ride the lift back up.

### Aftermath
Once the party makes it back up the lift with the Hatching Stone, they'll be greeted by Clast and the engineers. Clast will be astounded that they survived and accomplished their goal. The engineers will ask about the stone-finder. If Keth didn't survive, Clast will ask if they found any survivors. If he is with the party, Keth and Clast will embrace with tears of joy, as Keth is Clast's brother. The party will be asked for their filtration suits back. The miners have a doctor on stand-by who can tend to the party's wounds (restore their HP), but they'll have to go and get a proper cleric to treat any aether poisoning, an easy enough task for the clerics at the House of Sunlight.

The party will find only Thia and a couple acolytes at the church. Kellen has taken a party out to investigate the sigils and help anyone they can, foreshadowing that Kellen will come back partially transformed by the sigils and the events in chapter 5-2.

It'll be evening by this point. The party has a couple hours before dark, which might not be enough time to take care of the Mimic Ivy, but will leave them with a bit of downtime before hand. Use the general events from chapter 5-1 to fill time if necessary.

### Crystal Beam Attack
Most/All the creatures in the Deep Floor should have this attack.
Recharge 4-6
Creature shoots out a beam 30ft long and 5ft wide. Each creature in the affected area must make a DC 13 Dex save. Failure by 5 or more advances the target's aether poisoning symptoms by one stage and restrains the target until the end of their next turn. Failure by 4 or less causes the target to take 11 (2d8+2) force damage and become restrained until the end of their next turn.
