# Weapon of Light
This quest is to retrieve a large raw Hatching Stone that the clerics at the House of Sunlight can infuse with powerful light energy to be used to destroy the power source for the ritual that will transform the citizens of Loftran into subjects of Zehir.

## Raw Hatching Stone
Most of the Hatching Stones the players will find throughout the city are too small for this purpose. All of the larger ones will have been put through a magical process to make them better suited for more complicated magical spells, rendering them unable to simply store and emit light. The players will need to find a large and raw/unprocessed stone, which means they have to take a trip into the mines to the north of Loftran, known as the Glistening Mines.

## Objective
Obtain a large raw Hatching Stone and carry it back to the House of Sunlight

## Basic Dungeon Layout
1. First Floor - Miners quarters and living spaces. Staging locations for shipments of Hatching Stones back into the city. Most of the mined area. No map necessary for this floor.
2. Deep Floor - Uncharted deep floor. Only reachable by lift. Overabundance of magical energy wrecks havoc on living things. Here there be monsters and the large Hatching Stone.

## Complications
1. Players need to learn that the only large Hatching Stones left are on the Deep Floor
2. Players need to obtain several aether protection suits from the miners.
3. Players need to repair the lift in order to get down to the Deep Floor. They can gather supplies and try it themselves, or hire/persuade one of the mechanics
4. Monsters on the Deep Floor, including a couple miners that fell when the lift broke and were left for dead, but have transformed into crystal monstrosities
