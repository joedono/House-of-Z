# Tracking Down the Mark
The party has elected to attempt to Contact Other Plane in order to talk to a celestial being about how to destroy a dragon egg. This conversation needs to get the party moving to Southspark. It should be pretty easy for them to overhear a conversation between the celestial they're calling and one of his compatriots about a disturbance in the south of the Draffnir Island. Make sure the Island part is noticed by the players. They can roll History to see if they remember that the creation myth says that the corpse of the giant Draffnir is what created the continent they're on. The disturbance will obviously be Anguisa. They'll comment on how it's a dragon signature they've never seen before.

## Destroying the Egg
The party is likely to ask about how they can destroy the egg. The celestial will tell them about specific dragon-killing weapons forged from the bones of the ancient giants. These can be used to penetrate a dragon egg. The celestials have plenty, but can spare none due to the war. They might warn the players that the weapons can only be forged if the bones approve of the wielders and willingly give up a portion of themselves. This will be the players' first clue about the sentience of the giant bones scattered around Loftran.
