Central Theme: Coming together in a time of universal crisis

One of the sigils, or the main ritual location, should be in the king's castle. The king himself should be on the side of "there is no crisis" and be belligerent towards the players. This needs to be somewhat foreshadowed by other townsfolk also not taking the crisis seriously, and those that do are finding it difficult to find aid. No one believes that their loved ones were slaughtered by shadow demons.

## Creation Story
Something involving giants roaming the countryside. Many things in the world have to seem “bigger” than they should be. Ancient ruins should look built for beings 20-30 feet tall or more. Some of their skeletons still dot the landscape, although only the smaller ones are recognizable. The reason there’s so much magic and energy running under Loftran is that the largest giant of them all died, and Loftran is where its heart used to be.

## Investigation Notes
Be flexible in your scene ordering
Have more than one clue in a scene
Have the players find a clue or two automatically, without a roll or a chance at failure
Use handouts (maybe for Makaria's invitation)
Maybe consider not using checks at all. Just roleplaying
Consider how spells might be used
Avoid failures via dead ends. Failures should not come as a consequence of not figuring things out
