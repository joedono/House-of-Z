# Eloreth Manor
the players received this manor from Queen Amafrey of Loftran as a reward for saving the city from the Venomers and the Yuan-Ti Transformation Ritual.

The mansion used to belong to a noble family named Eloreth, an elven family that recently abandoned their position in the city to pursue ventures in other regions in the world. It was all rather mysterious, actually. The place will be dingy, but serviceable, and with signs of a sudden departure. It'll be a lot easier to maintain with staff.

## Secret Room
While exploring the mansion, the party will discover a door that has been locked with a 9th level Arcane Lock spell, which is currently beyond the magic of anyone in the party or the city. However, it can be opened with a password. The clues for the password are written in elvish on a piece of parchment nailed above the door.

```
Be ye friend or be ye foe?
Speak my name, or you'll never know.
Leave me a drink, or a plate of treats
and I'll keep your mansion nice and neat.
```

The required name is Pepper Orangepearl, and belongs to the brownie to lives behind the locked door in the residence. She'll only come out when the mansion is deserted, and he'll clean everything. She'll leave a clue to his name each time the party leaves out treats or a drink, leaves, and comes back. The clues will be pepper, an orange, and a pearl. Speaking the name will open the door and reveal a secret room. The room is bigger on the inside. The room has a teleportation circle that the magic users in the party can memorize the sigil sequence for, an arcane laboratory with many books, alchemical supplies, a magic item or three, and the making of the portal. This was actually what happened to the previous owner of the mansion. They opened a portal to the Abyss and disappeared through it.
