Ibal Ralovyre - Male Elf Rogue

Ibal had a “typical” childhood for his station growing up on “The Heavenly Cay” of the Seacracker Isles - tutors, classes, all manner of learning, but where his peers later turned to magical academia and the halls of the Ivory Tower (the foremost school of magic), he was drawn to the less arcane: history, psychology, physicals - the how and why of the world.  He left the echo chamber of society to expand his horizons, to investigate and observe. That's how, one day, he found himself being led away from the scene of a murder he was investigating by local law enforcement, explaining his need to pursue the truth and trying to prove his innocence in; neither of which worked well on the officers in charge.

Ibal is the third Child from a lesser noble family who made their fortune and names via artifice Father Folas Ralovyre (517) and Mother Chalia Ralovyre (456). Ibal’s parents think he is going through a phase and expect him to fall in line with the study of magic, as “he certainly has the intelligence and attention to detail for it,” at some point in the future. Be that as it may as he’s barely an adult (by elven standards) and they’ve allowed him his indulgences and his studies into the Psyche and Behavior.

Elder Brother Rhys took on the family trade and became a skilled artificer. Their relationship is professional, but being 322 himself, and old enough to have a child Ibal’s age (despite being unmarried); Rhys sees Ibal as a bit of an impetuous child. He often wonders whether their parents are being too lenient with Ibal, but generally trusts their judgement.

Middle Sister Allannia is an accomplished wizard and teacher at the Ivory Tower looking for less practical and more interesting uses for magic. As the middle child and in truth being closer in age (193) to Ibal than Rhys, Allannia is a doting older sister and perhaps takes the most interest in Ibal’s studies and interests.

## Brian
Ardin - Male Firbolg Warlock

Once a member of a firbolg clan living a peaceful, quiet life as shepherds of the forest, all of that changed in one night for Ardin. Death and destruction swooped down from the skies as a dragon burned through his village while he was off exploring the forest. The tribe had been guarding the skull of an ancient dragon, maybe that's what it wanted. Returning home to find nothing left, despair riddled his mind, leaving him wandering for days until exhaustion and starvation brought him to death's door. Mielikki (Goddess of the Forest) looked upon this child of the forest and sent a unicorn to save him, the same entity to which he bound himself in becoming a warlock.

Ardin came into town, was looking around the market for something to eat, bumped into one of a less than accepting guards causing him to spill his breakfast, which prompted said guard and his two like minded partners to start harassing him and throwing him into jail for stealing.

## Lyndsey
Liara - Non-binary "Tiefling" Cleric

Liara grew up in a family of scholars, dedicating her life to the monastic ideals of healing and religion. However, her entire clan was destroyed one day while she was out healing a minor injury in the next town over. The ancient text that her family was in charge of guarding had been stolen. Devastated and grieving, she left the ruins of her home and all she knew behind, following the one small clue left by the people who attacked. After a week on the road, she encountered a naked and bleeding Tiefling by the side of the road. Horrified at their condition, she bent to heal them... and blacked out as a surge of strange power washed over her. She is shy and still traumatized by the events that have befallen her, but determined to find and guard the text that is her family's legacy.

After Valmar was beaten up (and also stripped naked) by their townsfolk, they were left naked and bleeding out on the side of the street. Which is where Liara came across him. She tried to heal them and their wild magic kicked in, sucking her soul into their body. She also falls unconscious due to the effects of this, and the guards come across their shared body on the side of the street, assuming them to be drunk. They are arrested for public indecency.

## Kyle
Valmar Nohrmari - Non-binary Tiefling Sorceror

Valmar was never liked by his peers because anytime he were around, weird things happened. When he had the chance, he decided to move into the local mountain range. He had recently ventured down to one of the villages in the area when he was attacked by the villagers claiming that he was a demon. When he woke, he found himself in prison. Strangely, he now keeps losing track of large periods of time and he doesn't know why.

It turns out that Valmar had found a containment vessel for an ancient evil, the soul of the ancient black dragon Anguisa. After he opened the vessel, Anguisa's soul attempted to escape, but Valmar's wild magic activated and contained it in a compartment in Valmar's mind. Unfortunately, the containment wasn't complete when Valmar was spotted by the villagers. They saw the shadow behind him, thought him a monster, and lynched him. Liara happened upon him after the lynching, and attempting to heal him. Valmar's magic saw the missing ingredient in her, and pulled her in to aid in the containment. Now they fight to keep Anguisa imprisoned in shifts, with no memory of the fights...yet

## Andy
Theryn Ruinlief (pronounced Theer-rehn Roon-leef) - Male Half-Elf Ranger

Theeryn never really fit in with either his father's human side or his mother's elf side. He was sort of accepted by the humans, but with a sense of "You're still not welcomed here." Amongst the elves, he was flat out ostracized, told to keep away upon pain of death. Because of this, he found solace in the frontiers, away from society, and finding companionship with animals. However, he also developed a severe problem with alcohol. When arriving at a town, he typically rolls to the nearest tavern, and gets royally angry drunk, causing regular fistfights, and getting in trouble with the local guards. After a string of these incidents, he was finally locked away, hence his trip to the prison. He has since sobered up, but not without consequences; he's edgy around both humans and elves, and particularly anxious around any venue with alcohol. He will often forgo a drink to not go back down that road again.
