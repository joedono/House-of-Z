# Plot

## Hooks for next arc
- The king of Loftran is missing
- The door in the Eloreth Mansion is locked with powerful magics
  - Password is "Pepper Orangepearl"
  - Party currently knows the name "Pepper Orange"
  - Speaking the name will open the door and reveal a secret room. The room has a teleportation circle that the magic users in the party can memorize the sigil sequence for, an arcane laboratory with many books, alchemical supplies, a magic item or three, and the making of the portal. This was actually what happened to the previous owner of the mansion. They opened a portal to the Abyss and disappeared through it.

## Overarching Plot
Viserion is trying to cast a spell to resurrect the giants of old, who formed the world and warred over the land before the time of man. Doing so will visit untold destruction on anything small, including mankind. He needs a number of things in order to perform the ritual.
- A large quantity of magic, from a source related to a giant - Spiritwell Flower grown in the Heartswall District **GOT**
- A living direct connection to the giants - Blood of King Samuel of Loftran **GOT**
- Knowledge and Talent to cast the spell. Needs to resurrect his mate, Anguisa
  - Her skull was the keepsake/charge of Ardin's people **GOT**
  - Her soul was sealed hundreds of years ago, and currently lives in Valmar
- Something from the plane of the undead, the Abyss, to convert the energy stored in the flower
- A real connection to the giants - Any number of numerous bones left by the giants

For Anguisa's soul, Valmar and Liara have been taking turns fighting it inside Valmar's head when they switch out. After they're exposed to anything having to do with Viserion, Anguisa will start to fight harder, making herself more known to their conscious minds. They'll start to feel like they've just been somewhere else when they switch, rather than blinking and suddenly being somewhere new in the real world. They might start to feel exhausted or triumphant when they switch, as if they've just suffered a terrible defeat or had a wonderful victory. They might even start to hear Anguisa's voice from time to time. She'll be furious and determined to escape. She'll also be the main reason for Valmar's condition.

The **reason** Viserion is trying to resurrect a giant is so that it can be used in a war that Tiamat, the chromatic dragons, and their followers (including the Cult of Zehir) are fighting against Celestials and the gods. We're channeling Claymore, Hunter X Hunter, and Attack on Titan here. The world is a **LOT** bigger than the "little" island that has Loftran on it. The rest of the world is an unforgiving, hostile place. The sort of place that other mythologies refer to as the Age of Legend. It's happening now, but it's to big for its effects to be felt by the smaller folk in Loftran.

## Giant Bones
In order to reconstruct the giant, enough essence must be gathered from a giant's remains to re-corporealize it. The bones are scattered throughout the world, usually buried deep beneath the earth and indistinguishable from normal rock. The bones are semi-sentient, and can sense imminent discovery long before it actually happens. This will trigger the bones to defend themselves, usually with large sweeping effects that may not yield success right away. They're not the smartest things in the world, but they can create complex effects.

The Skull, located East of the town of Southspark, has mistakenly sensed imminent discovery for hundreds of years, and generates chaotic wind currents to defend itself. This has certainly discouraged travel through the area, but has also attracted Air Elementals, Cloud Giants, Flying Snakes, and other aerial hunters. The ever-presence of these airborne hunters means that the Skull always feels threatened, and thus always generates tornados and winds.

Another bone, the subject of chapter 9, has a different problem. This bone can generate convincing illusions: terrain, objects, people, animals, etc. A roving band of monsters camped too close to the bone's resting place, so it generated illusions of stronger monsters to chase them away. The real monsters wound up pledging loyalty to the illusions, and raided the nearby human settlement with bolstered numbers. The bone generated illusions of human reinforcements to try and chase the monsters away, but then the monsters retreated *closer* to the bone and the humans followed. The bone generated more monster illusions, and so on. The town and the monster settlement are now more illusion than real, and the bone shows no signs of coming up with another solution.

Other bones will have similar world-altering effects. Take inspiration from Control and the SCP Wiki.
