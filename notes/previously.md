Previously, on The World of Goo:

The party had followed the trail of clues from Ibal's murder case back to Elmwall Mansion, where they believed the real culprit to be a member of the Elmwall estate. They found the staff of the estate had all been poisoned and were mentally checked-out. The party found the hanged body of Isaac Elmwall, and encountered the insane and rambling Bartel Elmwall in the study. Bartel repeated the phrase "she made me do it" a few times, before vomiting up some black goo and transforming into a grotesque beast. After a battle, the party searched the study, discovering a handful of magical items, a love letter from Archebald to a green-eyed elven woman named Visera, and blueprints for a secret room to be built off of the wine cellar.

The party ventured down into the wine cellar (familiar territory, given all the sewers and basements the party has gone through so far), learned that the black goo used to be wine, and eventually found a horribly mutilated Isabella Elmwall, chained to a wall in the cellar. Her only memories of the past few weeks are of darkness and pain, and of anger at the woman Visera for invading her home and stealing her family away from her. The party did what they could for Isabella before curing the rest of the staff, three maids and a butler, and agreeing to escort the Lady Isabella across town to the House of Sunlight for better treatment.

Before they left, Fran, Ardin, and Ibal discovered the secret room. Within, they found a plethora of alchemical supplies and a garden with mysterious color-changing flowers. The garden was humming with magical energy. The dirt had been dug out in the middle, as if several plants (or one really big one) had been harvested. Finally, the trio found a list of items (mostly body parts) and locations, some of which were crossed out. A name was also present on the list, Anguisa.

Previously, on Women in Wine Cellars:

The party successfully rescued Isabella Elmwall from the wine cellar of her estate and escorted her and her remaining staff to the House of Sunlight for treatment. While there, she gave an account of what happened to her. Archebald made a "new friend" in Visera, an elven woman with piercing green eyes. Visera quickly wormed her way into the heart of Archebald and their sons. She was very interested in purchasing land, but seemed dissatisfied with all the prospects around Loftran that Archebald showed her. She convinced Archebald to build her an alchemical garden under his own mansion, where she grew powerful magical flowers. Visera bewitched the family, imprisoned Isabella, transformed into her, and took her place. She eventually poisoned the staff, drove the sons to insanity, and had Archebald killed by his own children. Ibal meticulously recorded all this in a journal, and the party left Isabella and her staff at the House of Sunlight for treatment.

The party turned in for rest at their Eloreth Manor. Ardin identified the deck of cards as a Deck of Illusions. Valmar had a horrible nightmare involved with fighting a shadow dragon and being saved by a mysterious girl holding a divine light. The party woke up and discussed options. Ardin revealed some parts of his tragic backstory and relation to Anguisa's Skull from the list in the garden. The party discovered the second of the three passwords to open the mysterious door in the mansion ("Pepper Orange"). They then spent the day running errands: Theryn and Ardin put up an ad for a butler/housekeeper for the manor, Liara bought "sharp" leather armor for Valmar, Fran and Ibal bought food for the manor and treats for the Brownie, and Fran bought a new set of plate mail. The group met up at Tabitha's shop after Ibal received a note from Tabitha requesting the party's adventuring services and Theryn and Ardin wanted to see if she knew anything about the list.

After buying some healing potions and a Potion of Watchful Rest, Tabitha described the job. She had ordered something from Durrstaft, high in the mountains, and hired the mercenary group known as the Red Drakes to deliver it to her across the treacherous-but-speedy Frostfall Pass. The delivery was due three days ago, and Tabitha is worried about the possibility of her special "something" going missing. She said it could be used for dangerous things if it falls into the wrong hands. She offered 300gp per party member for successfully retrieving the item, or 500gp per party member if they manage to bring back any of the Red Drakes. She also threw in the offer of enrolling the party in her "continuous discount" program. Once a week, they can purchase a single item from her shop at a heavy discount.

The party agreed, but they still have quite a few things left to do before they set out of the city: Ibal has to present his case to the queen (and possibly cash in their favor), the party wants to learn more about the mysterious list, and they have to decide whether to wait for housekeeper applicants to show up or build a mailbox to receive applications.

And so we begin, inside Tabitha's Alchemy Shop...

Previously, on I've Got A Hole In My Pocket:

Many things were done! Ibal was acquitted of his crime after presenting all his evidence to a very grateful Kathra Dankil, a clerk in the queen's office who loved getting things off her TODO pile. He took one of his old wanted posters as a souvenir. Theryn enjoyed a nice little walk around the castle and made some new friends. Ardin bought everyone a set of stylish winter clothing from Threads & Thrashings, and some lumber and tools to make a dropbox. Fran and Valmar hired the Hansen family to watch their house for about two weeks while the party is out adventuring and waiting for other applicants to come in. Liara earned her passage into the Forbidden Section of the Wizard's Library and researched her "condition." The party bunked in for the night in a manor that's feeling more and more like a home. Liara had a nightmare about an army of snake people made of darkness threatening her before Valmar stepped in and saved her. He turned to face a growling darkness and told Liara it was "her turn now" before pushing her through a door of light.

The next morning, the party received the final piece to the puzzle of the mysterious room: The name of the Brownie, Pepper Orangepearl. The door opened to reveal a wizard's dream workshop (bigger on the inside), with books and magical equipment scattered everywhere. On the other side was a teleportation circle that could be used to teleport back to the manor from anywhere by a spellcaster powerful enough to know how. Finally, on the far wall was a sinister black scorch mark with remnants of demonic energy still wisping off of it. After some exhaustive research, the party discovered that the scorch mark is most likely the remains of a portal to the Abyss. Maybe the Eloreth family had wizards who opened the portal themselves and vanished through it. Maybe something *pulled* them through. Whatever the case, Liara and Ardin determined that the portal remnants are not dangerous unless someone foolhardy attempts the ritual again.

The party packed up and set out for the mountains around Durrstaft. They were bound for Frostfall Pass, the last known location of the Red Drakes and Tabitha's mysterious "special delivery". Tabitha described the Red Drakes as a four-person mercenary band: A human rogue, a tiefling mage, a half-orc fighter, and a dragonborn druid. After a hard, but manageable, hike up the switchbacks of the mountains, the party encountered a frozen river.

...and heard growling amidst the trees.

Previously, on What's This? What's This? What the Fuck is This?

The party made their trek up the Durrstaft Mountains on their way to Frostfall Pass, taking the reverse route that the Red Drakes would have taken to get to Loftran. The threat of a blizzard loomed in the sky. During the climb, the party encountered a frozen river guarded by "white people." After some shenanigans getting across, the party discovered an owlbear whose eyes had been brutally removed. Theryn successfully calmed the creature and conversed with it via a Speak with Animals spell. The party learned little, other than it was severely traumatized. The party moved on and discovered a body wrapped in a Red Drake cloak hanging from a tree and spinning in the wind. Fran got his leg caught in a bear trap, and the party discovered that the body belongs to a dear. After several more hours of hiking, the party finally made it to Frostfall pass and discovered the Red Drake encampment, along with the body of Iovus, the human rogue member of the mercenary band, and Verna, the extremely rude spirit of a dwarven shield maiden inhabiting a wonderfully crafted warhammer.

After a night's rest in the Tiny Hut, which was disturbed by some creepy noises outside, the party discovered what looked like an owlbear cave, with Thalia, the tiefling mage member of the Red Drakes. She came rigged with an explosive vial, but was promptly Revivified by Liara. She pointed the party at a secret door at the back of the cave, which the party discovered hid all kinds of gruesomness. Among other things, the party discovered Garlan, the dragonborn druid and third member of the Red Drakes. That just leaves Bruga, Verna's owner and a half-orc fighter. Before the party could explore further, the creature that had been stalking them finally showed itself: a four-legged patchwork creature the size of a car.

Roll initiative.

Previously, on Game Over, Man!!

After some careful preparation and a few well-rolled stealth checks, the party made mincemeat of the monstrosity that had been stalking them since they arrived in Frostfall Pass. The creature fled, clutching to it's one remaining hit point. The party then discovered the laboratory of the deranged alchemist, Karina, and her imperfect monstrosities. A battle ensued. Valmar and Theryn were slain, with Theryn being sent from the realm of unconsciousness into true death for a brief time. Fortunately, the imperfect monsters that were providing a buffer to Karina couldn't live very long outside of their vats with no nutrient feeding tubes attached. Sensing the tide of battle shifting, Karina attempted to flee her cave, only to be brought down by Ardin's Cone of Cold spell.

The party gathered the remaining Red Drakes and what gear they could find of use in the lab. They found the "special delivery" that Tabitha had sent them for, with Garlan taking a special interest in keeping a hold of it. Thalia, Bruga, and Garlan held a small funeral for Iovus, their remaining member, who had been tied up outside and left to die of exposure after having his teeth and tongue removed. Ardin then impressed them with a warm and dry place to sleep for the night at the foot of the Durrstahft Mountains.

Ardin identified the vials and goggles the group retrieved from the lab. Ibal sent a status update to Tabitha, who replied and asked about the status of her package. Ardin, Ibal, and Garlan opened the box and discovered what appeared to be a fully intact Black Dragon Egg. Questions abound.

Previously, on How to Train Your Dragon

Garlan of the Red Drakes was determined to take the Black Dragon Egg from Tabitha's "special package" back to his druidic monastery to ask his elders how to destroy it. He firmly believed that dragons are abominations and cannot be allowed to exist in this world, much less as a supply to someone as intelligent as Tabitha. Unfortunately, Garlans' plans were cut extremely short. After a fitful night of rest, Valmar and Theryn were intensely curious to see the egg for themselves. Upon laying eyes on the egg, the mostly dormant soul of Anguisa the Anguisher within Valmar broke free of the mind prison that Valmar and Liara had been keeping her in (unbeknownst to LITERALLY EVERYONE), seized control of Valmar's body, and attacked the party. Garlan, Theryn, and Ardin fell to the creature before Liara managed to wrest control back and force Anguisa back into the mind prison. Anguisa left some cryptic words about the egg being her offspring and about how the party will eventually encounter her mate, who will end them. Liara recalled a quote from some of her own research into their condition; a wizard who attempted to hold a demon in his own mind cage recorded his last thoughts in his journal, "clearly, one mind is not sufficient."

After a great deal of debate over what to do with the egg, the party decided to finish delivering it to Tabitha, as she had given them the impression that she was expecting only an egg shell and was surprised to find that the package contained a viable dragon egg. Tabitha said that she has no intention of hatching the thing, only to continuously harvest shavings of the outer egg shell, which will regenerate so long as the dragon inside is alive. The party said goodbye to Bruga, then accompanied Thalia back to the Wizard's College, hoping to get some more information on Liara's condition.

As chance would have it, the party ran into Professor Baern Frostbeard, one of the heads of Biological Research at the college. Excited by the opportunity to examine such a unique specimen as Liara/Valmar/Anguisa, Baern called on his assistant, Geoffrey, to wake up the rest of his staff, and he led the party to his main examination room. He asked Liara to lie down on the examination table, eyes gleaming as thoughts of his doctorate ran through his mind, and he started fastening the restraints....
