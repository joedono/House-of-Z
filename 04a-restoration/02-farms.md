# Loftran Farmland
The party has elected to investigate the farmlands south of Loftran, to see if any of them are having supply problems, which would point to them having a Mimic Ivy infestation. The problem is that there is a sigil in the southern part of the city that was activated a while ago, meaning that the farmers have stage 2 or 3 symptoms, which includes general animosity towards people not affected by the sigil, including the party. They'll use subtle or not-so-subtle ways to thwart the players. They'll have *very* obvious snake eyes too.


## NPCs

### Lars and Mareesa Whittletwig
Halfling farming couple. The first npcs the players encounter on the farms. Suffering from Stage 4 sigil infection.


## Events

### Introductions
The players approach the farms. If they do so without hostility, they will be greeted by Lars Whittletwig, a male halfling out harvesting grain to feed the livestock. He's friendly enough, so long as the players don't mention their grand mission to deal with the sigils. Now that the party mentions it, harvest has been less than stellar this year. Marisha Whittletwig, Lars' wife, will approach and ask who the visitors are. Upon her approach, the players will notice that she has snake eyes.

### Secret Revealed
If the players reveal their mission to deal with the sigils, or anything related to Zehir, the Whittletwigs will immediately turn hostile, but avoid direct conflict. They'll insist that there is no infestation and that if the party doesn't leave immediately, they'll alert the guards. The party still needs the Mimic Ivy, forcing them to sneak onto the farm, hopefully still during the day, when there are no shadow monsters around.

### Complications
The farmers will fill the fields with crude traps to hinder the players. Traps like trip ropes, crudely made caltrops, rigged beehives, and piles of manure. They won't attack the players directly though.

### Locating the Mimic Ivy
A few bouts of investigation will show the players the unripe fruit, which they can identify as Mimic Ivy and start the fight to harvest some.
