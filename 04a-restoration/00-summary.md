# Weapon of Restoration
This quest is to retrieve the final ingredient to a powerful magical antidote that Theresa or the clerics at the House of Sunlight must brew for the players in order to destroy the power source for the ritual that will transform the citizens of Loftran into subjects of Zehir.

The players can attempt to help Theresa or the clerics obtain the other items, but it's not necessary. One of them will give the party a pot with magically fertile soil. They only need to stick a sample of the Mimic Ivy into it and water it regularly in order to keep it alive long enough to be made part of the antidote. It doesn't matter if the main body of the plant is killed, so long as it is not burned.

## Mimic Ivy
The primary missing ingredient is Mimic Ivy, which is very difficult to find and potentially dangerous. The players know that it grows in areas with fruit that ripens. It hides itself by transforming to look like fruit that isn't quite ripe for harvest yet. It never ripens, so it is never harvested and left along long enough to propagate. It is fond of farmland and vineyards. It eventually takes over an entire crop, causing the entire crop to never ripen and the people to starve. The main symptom of an infestation to an outsider is a field with reduced output.

Once revealed, Mimic Ivy will bloom a large green flower and defend itself.

## Locations
Theresa and the clerics can think of two likely locations where the party might find Mimic Ivy.
* The Loftran vineyards to the northeast - complication: the second-most prominent vineyard in Loftran has experienced a drop in supply lately. It's owned by Makaria, business rival to the late Archebald Elmwall, the victim in Ibal's murder.
* The farmlands to the south - complication: One of the sigils activated on a previous night was in the southern area of the city, so the farmers and other citizens are more affected by the sigil's poison.
