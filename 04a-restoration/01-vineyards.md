# Loftran Vineyards
One option for the players to find Mimic Ivy is the vineyards in the NE of the city. The players might remember that Aiden is a fruit and wine merchant and very likely to know which farms are having problems. If they don't, and they still decide to investigate the vineyards, they'll find out that the second-most prominent vineyard owner, Makaria, has been having trouble with her harvest.


## NPCs

### Aiden Collander
Human Merchant. Prominent (and loud) merchant of fresh fruits and fine wines. If the players find him, he can help them find vineyards who are showing reduced output.

### Bel'krell the doorman
Red tiefling. Works as a doorman for Makaria. Very Geaves-mannerisms, such as the tendency to say "mmmmmm, yessss" in a monotone voice.

### Makaria
Female tiefling with lavender skin. Noble vineyard owner and business rival to Archebald Elmwall. Might drop some information about his untimely death. Her estate is the second-most successful vineyard in the wine business in all of Loftran. Only the Elmwall Estate is more successful. Makaria doesn't actually wish any ill on the Elmwalls, she enjoys the competition. Makaria is known to have lavish parties where she serves her wine.


## Events

### Getting Help
If the players remember Aiden Collander as a fruit and wine merchant, they could seek him out. He's having his shop repaired after the recent attacks. He's neutral towards the players, but when they inquire about vineyards not producing as normal, he'll be willing to part with the information, if they buy some wine. He'll also hook them up with a writ of endorsement that will legitimize them to Makaria's staff and encourage them to give the players access to the vineyards. A DC 20 perception check from the players will have them notice that Aiden's eyes change to snake eyes for less than a second, due to his proximity to a sigil. If the players come here after finding the Hatching Stone, Aiden's eyes are snake-like all the time, but he is still neutral towards the players.

### Introductions
Knocking on the door to Makaria's estate, they'll be greeted by their doorman. If they have the writ of endorsement from Aiden, they can use it to gain entry into the mansion. Otherwise, they'll have to find another way to get the doorman to let them in, as the doorman will not allow them entry as they are not expected guests, do not have an invitation, and do not have a writ of endorsement from a business contact or other reliable source.

### Meeting Makaria
Makaria has a bunch of information that will be useful to the players, especially Ibal. Makaria will wonder what ever became of her business rival, Archebald. She'll comment on him not responding to the invitation to the gathering she's planning on having next week. She normally hosts such parties regularly, but she hasn't had one in several weeks due to her supply trouble. She's dipping into her emergency supplies to host one and keep her appearances up. She might also mention that she hoped Archebald's death would give her the room she needed to get a monopoly on the wine business in Loftran, but she'll comment that she'll miss the rivalry, as she quite liked the competition. Not to mention that Makaria's recent supply problem is hurting business. Her grapes just won't ripen, cluing the players in to the fact that she has a Mimic Ivy infestation.

### The Help
Makaria's master brewer, and creator of some of her most popular wine recipes is Baelor Oakenbarrel. Baelor is mad as hell that the vineyard is doing poorly, but the idea of Mimic Ivy hasn't occurred to him. He probably believes that it's something in the soil, but can't figure it out. Makaria will summon him once the party has introduced themselves and the offer to check out the vineyard is made.

Makaria's master harvester and farmer is a dullard named Bart. He hasn't the faintest idea what Mimic Ivy is and is at a loss as to what's causing the supply issue. He keeps insisting that he "did exactly as his father taught him" when planting and harvesting the grapes. Makaria is extremely frustrated with Bart's performance, and is on the verge of hiring new help when the players arrive. Bart's pet cat disappeared out in the vineyard two days ago. He's obviously depressed about losing his Mittens.

### Sneaking In
Not necessary, as the party went to see Aiden and got a writ of endorsement.

If the players fail to get past the doorman, they can still sneak in to the vineyard. They just have to get past the wrought-iron fence with the magical warding. A DC 15 Investigation or Arcana check will reveal a small spot where the ward is weak, where the players can either climb the fence or bend the bars to get entry. If they go this route, then the guards will be summoned soon after the fight with the Mimic Ivy starts.

### The Vineyards
The vineyards will likely be deserted when the players investigate. A few bouts of investigation will show the players the unripe fruit, which they can identify as Mimic Ivy and start the fight to harvest some.
