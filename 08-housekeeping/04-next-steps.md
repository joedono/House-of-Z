# Next Steps
The list the party found should give them a todo list of places to visit.

If they think of it, they can inquire as to whether Isabella Elmwall was seen recently. They'll discover that there's a record of her leaving the city a couple days ago, just before the ritual was stopped by the players. The players can learn that she boarded a boat heading north on the Giantvein River, but they won't learn that she'll have turned West to go to the Seacracker Islands in search of Giant Finger Bones.

## The Experiment
-- BOOKMARK --
The party has decided to submit Liara/Valmar to Professor Baern Frostbeard, the head of the humanoid biological research department at the Wizard's College, to see if he can figure out what the deal is with Liara/Valmar/Anguisa. He's hoping to get a research paper out of her and has called on the rest of his staff to come help with the research.

Baern will be able to detect the presence of three souls within Valmar/Liara: Two humanoid and one dragon. He'll be able to pull up images of them on a sort of hatching stone hologram projector. This will trigger another Anguisa transformation, but she'll be unable to muster enough strength to break the magical bonds on the specimen table.

After taking the readings and reviewing the notes, Baern will attempt a soul extraction into what he thinks is a suitable vessel: an empty hatching stone. Unfortunately, the process will fail. The stone will shatter, but Anguisa will remain within Valmar/Liara. Baern will loathe to admit it, but he just doesn't have the equipment here to do the extraction. He'll have to recommend that the party seek out his former academic advisor at the Ivory Tower instead, Professor Adran Galanodel (male high elf).
