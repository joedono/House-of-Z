# Tabitha's Package
Tabitha had ordered a special ingredient from Durrstahft, and it's overdue. She asks the players if they'll journey into the mountains and look through the Frostfall Pass to find the couriers, a mercenary band known as the Red Drakes.

## Snowstalkers Differences
Tabitha will be expecting a shipment *from* Durrstahft by way of the mountain pass. It hasn't arrived, and she's worried, more for the lost material than any lost life or injury.

The gem of seeing by the bear trap doesn't exist (I can't give them truesight before the City of Illusions quest). Instead, the party will find an Astral Shard in Karina's workshop after the final fight https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/astral-shard

Bruga's Maul+1 is a Warhammer+1. It still has the spirit of the dwarven shield maiden Verna in it.

Refer to The Snow Stalkers for further details: file:///E:/Users/Joe/Documents/RPG/D&D%205.0/Campaigns/Bundle%20of%20Horror%202/5%20-%20The%20Snow%20Stalkers%20V1/The%20Snow%20Stalkers%20V1.pdf

The party has explored much of Karina's lab. They found Garlan, but haven't freed him yet. They were just about to enter the final room when the Snow Mutant appeared and attacked.

Poisoned - A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
DON'T FORGET LEGENDARY ACTIONS

## Aftermath
There will be two lasting consequences from this encounter:

### Karina's Last Act
Karina is a long-time arch-nemesis of Tabitha. Near the end of the battle, she'll attempt to get close to Ibal and shove several of her explosive vials into the Bag of Sending. If she succeeds, the resulting explosion back at Tabitha's shop will destroy much of the merchandise and kill Helen, Tabitha's assistant.

Tabitha might swear revenge until she learns that the party has already dispatched Karina. Tabitha will immediately start putting together an expedition to Karina's lab (and might hire the party again). If the Snow Mutant is still alive, it might come back to harass the party again, with a pack of loyal snow apes (or something).

THIS FAILED!!

### The Special Delivery
The *special order* is a fully intact Black Dragon Egg, picked up in the region around Durrstahft. It is the long-dormant offspring of Viserion and Anguisa. Viserion doesn't know that it exists, as Anguisa was killed/sealed before she could hatch it. Seeing the egg will provoke an intense reaction from Anguisa's soul inside Valmar/Liara. She'll attempt to seize control of the body and attack the party, prompting Liara/Valmar to make successive DC 17 Wisdom saving throws. The first check is made normally. Upon failure, Liara/Valmar are thrust away from the "light", and can thereafter work together to seize control, granting advantage on subsequent Wisdom saving throws through the Help action. Upon the first success, the spirit of Anguisa is imprisoned in the mind cage once again, and no further saves are necessary (for now).

Garlan sensed evil within the package before. This incident will solidify that resolve and he'll entreat the rest of the party to agree with him. Of course, Tabitha won't pay them at all if they don't return with the package.

Tabitha thought the package was just the egg-shell ("nearly whole" she was told). She planned on using shavings from the egg shell in her potions. She didn't know there was still a living dragon inside. She might still try to keep it, but will also be willing to hand it over to the players. She'll refuse to destroy it. She's only mildly concerned about keeping something that dangerous in her shop.
