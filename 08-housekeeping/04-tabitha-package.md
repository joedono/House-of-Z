# Tabitha's Package
Tabitha had ordered a special ingredient from Durrstahft, and it's overdue. She asks the players if they'll journey into the mountains and look through the Frostfall Pass to find the couriers, a mercenary band known as the Red Drakes.

## Snowstalkers Differences
Tabitha will be expecting a shipment *from* Durrstahft by way of the mountain pass. It hasn't arrived, and she's worried, more for the lost material than any lost life or injury.

The *special order* is a Black Dragon Egg. It is the long-dormant offspring of Viserion and Anguisa. Viserion doesn't know that it exists, as Anguisa was killed and sealed before she could hatch it. Seeing the egg will provoke an intense reaction from Anguisa's soul inside Valmar/Liara, giving them a headache and hearing a faint voice in their head. The egg can be hatched by submerging it in boiling poison liquid, but the party won't know that on their own. Tabitha will, but she'll refuse to tell them. Tabitha thought the package was just the egg-shell ("nearly whole" she was told). She planned on using shavings from the egg shell in her potions. She didn't know there was still a living dragon inside.

Bruga's Maul+1 is a Warhammer+1. It still has the spirit of the dwarven shield maiden Verna in it.
