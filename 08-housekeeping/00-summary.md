# Summary
The party has a list of locations to investigate that they found in Visera's garden:
- **Anguisa's Skull - Kornith Forest**
- Anguisa's Soul - Durrstahft *vessel missing??*
- **Loftran Leyline Magic**
- Abyss

It'll be completely up to them which they want to try investigating. They'll be able to get to the Abyss if/when they solve the riddle of the Eloreth Brownie and open the locked door in the mansion. The rest can simply be traveled to.

If they need a push, have someone mention that the royal family of Loftran is known for having the "blood of giants" running through their veins, which will be a clue that Viserion has King Samuel of Loftran with him.
