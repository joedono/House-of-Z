# Summary
The party has a list of locations to investigate that they found in Visera's garden:
- **Anguisa's Skull - Kornith Forest**
- Anguisa's Soul - Durrstahft *vessel missing??*
- **Loftran Leyline Magic**
- Abyss
- Pelvis - Third Finger Peak Mountain
- Finger Bones x3 - Seacracker Islands
- **Blood of the Giants**
- Spine - Mount Stratha
- Skull - East of Southspark?
- Ribs - Lindenvale?
- Other Bones - Unknown

It'll be completely up to them which they want to try investigating. They'll be able to get to the Abyss if/when they solve the riddle of the Eloreth Brownie and open the locked door in the mansion. The rest can simply be traveled to.

If they need a push, have someone mention that the royal family of Loftran is known for having the "blood of giants" running through their veins, which will be a clue that Viserion has King Samuel of Loftran with him.

## Tabitha's Package
Tabitha had ordered a special ingredient from Durrstahft, and it's overdue. She asks the players if they'll journey into the mountains and look through the Frostfall Pass to find the couriers, a mercenary band known as the Red Drakes. The party agreed to look, but they have some logistics to take care of first.

-- BOOKMARK--

## Ibal's Case
Ibal has meticulously compiled a list of evidence and recorded his story. He needs to present it to the royal court so they can take his name off the criminals listing. Currently, the record says that he was arrested and the system is still trying to catch up with everything that happened during the Snake Ritual. Between that, and him being known as a member of the group that saved the city to the Queen, it is likely that no one will ever pursue him again. However, his name is still on the guards' wanted list, so it's possible that someone might find it and go looking for him again.

Given all of that, the "normal" proceedings for criminal charges won't really apply. Normally, he'd have a trial where he'd be able to present evidence defending himself, and the guards and prosecutors would be prosecuting him. The guard who arrested him is one of those permanently turned into a Yuan-Ti and has fled the city. The prosecutor would be someone hired by Isabella Elmwall, and the Isabella who was acting in public at the time (Viserion) has also fled the city with King Samuel in tow, so that's not happening. The real Isabella is being cared for at the House of Sunlight, and would probably be more than happy to drop the charges (and probably put out a new bounty for an elven woman named Visera).

Ibal can wait until someone comes to arrest him, and he can go through the (lengthy) court proceedings the normal way, or he can get a head-start and present his evidence himself. All he really has to do is make a statement to the clerks at the court's office, then wait for enough time for a guard to locate Isabella, collect her statement, and verify that it lines up with Ibal's claims. That shouldn't take more than an hour or two.

The clerk will be Kathra Dankil. Dwarven woman. Very dismissive and sticks to her routine, not unlike the bank clerks from the Witcher. She'll be cold to Ibal unless he either brings up taking one of the cases off of her massive TODO list, or flirts with her.

## Housekeeper Interviews
Ardin rolls a 20 on the job posting for housekeeper(s). That's enough to bring in 1-2 people every couple days or so. The party did NOT mention the presence of a fey creature in the house, but did put "further responsibilities to be discussed" on the posting. They asked for a housekeeper, stocker, and cook.

The party can wait around for applicants to show up (which is the common method) or they can set up a mail box for people to drop off applications at.

### First Applicants
**Feng** - Male half-orc. Used to work as a janitor at the Black Rose Inn. His father, Cecil, owns the inn. Feng is here in Loftran, striking out on his own, plying his trade. He dreams of working for a noble house, and will be a little disappointed when he finds out the party is more of a ragtag group of adventurers. He'll have no problem working in a house with a fey creature, but will unwittingly attract ghosts occasionally. He's good at cleaning and stocking, but horrible at cooking.

**Kerri Buckman** - Female human. A middle-aged widow with three grown children (two sons and a daughter). Basically lives alone and is looking for something to keep her busy. She's good at cleaning, stocking, and cooking. She **does** have issues working in a house with a fey creature, believing that it'll steal her things or whisk her away to the Feywild while she sleeps. If she isn't told up-front about the Brownie, she'll gradually become suspicious over about a month's time. Sooner if the party makes a mess and it gets cleaned up before she gets to it. One condition for her employment is that at least one guest room must be kept empty in case any of her children come to visit.

**Tarhun Turnuroth** - Male dragonborn. A con-man. Presents as an experienced butler with references that are all fake upon investigation. If the party hires him, he'll steal as much as there is to steal (a few pieces of valuable silverware and one painting) before vanishing. The brownie will leave a furious note for the players, saying that he had to chase Tarhun out of the mansion. This won't cause Pepper to leave, but she'll be pissed for a little while.

**Albert Glendale, Atala Jassan, Althaea Amakiir, and Reed Tosscobble** - Male human, female human, female elf, and male halfling. The former head butler, maid, cook, and groundskeeper from the Elmwall Estate. With their mistress Isabella settling in for an extended (possibly indefinite) stay at the House of Sunlight, and all their masters dead, the four remaining employees of Elmwall are out of work.

## Snowstalkers
Tabitha will be expecting a shipment *from* Durrstahft by way of the mountain pass. It hasn't arrived, and she's worried, more for the lost material than any lost life or injury.

The *special order* is a Black Dragon Egg. It is the long-dormant offspring of Viserion and Anguisa. Viserion doesn't know that it exists, as Anguisa was killed and sealed before she could hatch it. Seeing the egg will provoke an intense reaction from Anguisa's soul inside Valmar/Liara, giving them a headache and hearing a faint voice in their head. The egg can be hatched by submerging it in boiling poison liquid, but the party won't know that on their own. Tabitha will, but she'll refuse to tell them. Tabitha thought the package was just the egg-shell ("nearly whole" she was told). She planned on using shavings from the egg shell in her potions. She didn't know there was still a living dragon inside.

Bruga's Maul+1 is a Warhammer+1. It still has the spirit of the dwarven shield maiden Verna in it.

## Queen's Boon
The party is likely to turn in their IOU from the Queen after learning of Isabella's survival and getting her testimony and her wish to acquit Ibal of her husband's murder. They're likely to make good on their desire for a ship. The Queen will offer them a choice between an unfurnished Brigantine that is seaworthy and in good repair, and a [Folding Boat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/folding-boat). She'll take them down to the Giantvein River, which borders Loftran, to present the choice to the party.

If they ask for something else, deal with it accordingly.

## Next Steps
The list the party found should give them a todo list of places to visit.

If they think of it, they can inquire as to whether Isabella Elmwall was seen recently. They'll discover that there's a record of her leaving the city a couple days ago, just before the ritual was stopped by the players. The players can learn that she boarded a boat heading north, but they won't learn that she'll have turned West to go to the Seacracker Islands in search of Giant Finger Bones.
