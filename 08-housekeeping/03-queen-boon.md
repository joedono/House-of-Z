# Queen's Boon
The party is likely to turn in their IOU from Queen Amafrey after learning of Isabella's survival and getting her testimony and her wish to acquit Ibal of her husband's murder.

They're likely to make good on their desire for a ship. The Queen will offer them a choice between an unfurnished Brigantine that is seaworthy and in good repair, and a [Folding Boat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/folding-boat). She'll take them down to the Giantvein River, which borders Loftran, to present the choice to the party.

If they ask for something else, deal with it accordingly.
