# Next Steps
The list the party found should give them a todo list of places to visit.

If they think of it, they can inquire as to whether Isabella Elmwall was seen recently. They'll discover that there's a record of her leaving the city a couple days ago, just before the ritual was stopped by the players. The players can learn that she boarded a boat heading north, but they won't learn that she'll have turned West to go to the Seacracker Islands in search of Giant Finger Bones.
