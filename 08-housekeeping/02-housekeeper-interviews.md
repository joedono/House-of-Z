# Housekeeper Interviews
Ardin rolls a 20 on the job posting for housekeeper(s). That's enough to bring in 1-2 people every couple days or so. The party did NOT mention the presence of a fey creature in the house, but did put "further responsibilities to be discussed" on the posting. They asked for a housekeeper, stocker, and cook.

The party can wait around for applicants to show up (which is the common method) or they can set up a mail box for people to drop off applications at.

## Applicants
**Feng** - Male half-orc. Used to work as a janitor at the Black Rose Inn. His father, Cecil, owns the inn. Feng is here in Loftran, striking out on his own, plying his trade. He dreams of working for a noble house, and will be a little disappointed when he finds out the party is more of a ragtag group of adventurers. He'll have no problem working in a house with a fey creature, but will unwittingly attract ghosts occasionally. He's good at cleaning and stocking, but horrible at cooking.

Rate - 20gp/month

**Kerri Buckman** - Female human. A middle-aged widow with three grown children (two sons and a daughter). Basically lives alone and is looking for something to keep her busy. She's good at cleaning, stocking, and cooking. She **does** have issues working in a house with a fey creature, believing that it'll steal her things or whisk her away to the Feywild while she sleeps. If she isn't told up-front about the Brownie, she'll gradually become suspicious over about a month's time. Sooner if the party makes a mess and it gets cleaned up before she gets to it. One condition for her employment is that at least one guest room must be kept empty in case any of her children come to visit.

Rate - 10gp/month

**Tarhun Turnuroth** - Male dragonborn. A con-man. Presents as an experienced butler with references that are all fake upon investigation. If the party hires him, he'll steal as much as there is to steal (a few pieces of valuable silverware and one painting) before vanishing. The brownie will leave a furious note for the players, saying that he had to chase Tarhun out of the mansion. This won't cause Pepper to leave, but she'll be pissed for a little while.

Rate - 10gp/month

**Albert Glendale, Atala Jassan, Althaea Amakiir, and Reed Tosscobble** - Male human, female human, female elf, and male halfling. The former head butler, maid, cook, and groundskeeper from the Elmwall Estate. With their mistress Isabella settling in for an extended (possibly indefinite) stay at the House of Sunlight, and all their masters dead, the four remaining employees of Elmwall are out of work.

Rate - 20gp/month for Albert, 15gp/month for Atala and Althaea each, and 10gp/month for Reed. Total = 45gp/month for all four staffers
