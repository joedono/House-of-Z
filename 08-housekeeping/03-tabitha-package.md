# Tabitha's Package
Tabitha had ordered a special ingredient from Durrstahft, and it's overdue. She asks the players if they'll journey into the mountains and look through the Frostfall Pass to find the couriers, a mercenary band known as the Red Drakes.

## Snowstalkers Differences
Tabitha will be expecting a shipment *from* Durrstahft by way of the mountain pass. It hasn't arrived, and she's worried, more for the lost material than any lost life or injury.

The gem of seeing by the bear trap doesn't exist (I can't give them truesight before the City of Illusions quest). Instead, the party will find an Astral Shard in Karina's workshop after the final fight https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/astral-shard

Bruga's Maul+1 is a Warhammer+1. It still has the spirit of the dwarven shield maiden Verna in it.

--BOOKMARK--
The party has explored much of Karina's lab. They found Garlan, but haven't freed him yet. They were just about to enter the final room when the Snow Mutant appeared and attacked.

## Aftermath
There will be two lasting consequences from this encounter:

### Karina's Last Act
Karina is a long-time arch-nemesis of Tabitha. Near the end of the battle, she'll attempt to get close to Ibal and shove several of her explosive vials into the Bag of Sending. If she succeeds, the resulting explosion back at Tabitha's shop will destroy much of the merchandise and kill Helen, Tabitha's assistant.

Tabitha might swear revenge until she learns that the party has already dispatched Karina. Tabitha will immediately start putting together an exhibition to Karina's lab (and might hire the party again). If the Snow Mutant is still alive, it might come back to harass the party again, with a pack of loyal snow apes (or something).

### The Special Delivery
The *special order* is a fully intact Black Dragon Egg, picked up in the region around Durrstahft. It is the long-dormant offspring of Viserion and Anguisa. Viserion doesn't know that it exists, as Anguisa was killed/sealed before she could hatch it. Seeing the egg will provoke an intense reaction from Anguisa's soul inside Valmar/Liara. She'll attempt to seize control of the body and attack the party, prompting Liara/Valmar to make successive DC 17 Wisdom saving throws. The first check is made normally. Upon failure, Liara/Valmar are thrust away from the "light", and can thereafter work together to sieze control, granting advantage on subsequent Wisdom saving throws through the Help action. Upon the first success, the spirit of Anguisa is imprisoned in the mind cage once again, and no further saves are necessary (for now).

Tabitha thought the package was just the egg-shell ("nearly whole" she was told). She planned on using shavings from the egg shell in her potions. She didn't know there was still a living dragon inside. She might still try to keep it, but will also be willing to hand it over to the players. She'll refuse to destroy it. She's only mildly concerned about keeping something that dangerous in her shop.

The egg can be hatched by submerging it in boiling acid overnight. Tabitha knows this, although it'll take a very high Persuasion or Intimidation roll to get her to say anything. The party can also find the method in the Wizard's Library (NOT in the forbidden section. There are books on the lifecycle of dragons freely available). It'll hatch into a Black Dragon Hatchling https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Dragon_Hatchling_(5e_Monster) that the players can decide what to do with, but keeping it will agitate Anguisa periodically.

#### Soul Separation
There is a good chance that this incident will spur the party to search for some method of extracting Anguisa. Their best chance at a lead will be the Wizard's College, but they won't have anything that'll work on the soul of a dragon. They'll be loathe to admit it, but their best chance might be the rival college, the Ivory Tower, at the Heavenly Cay, Ibal's Home, in the Frostcracker Isles. This will present a golden opportunity to integrate one or more of the Candlekeep Mystery adventures, but is also in the area where 3 of the Giant Finger Bones are located.
