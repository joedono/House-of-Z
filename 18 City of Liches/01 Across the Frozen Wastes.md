# Across the Frozen Wastes
Zeethrae makes her home in her old pirate ship, The Shadow, which is locked in the ice of The Frozen Sea, amidst many other broken citadels and shipwrecks.

Getting across the sea is a fool's errand. The subconscious idea of this sea is what gave the rulers of Durrstaft the idea for their frozen lake executions. There are frozen skeletal limbs poking out everywhere here. The main hazard is the hundreds of gelatinous cubes that live just under the surface of the ice and slide across its surface. They form an ever-changing maze of dissolving walls.

If the party played their cards right in the City of Liches, they'll have an ice skiff that will allow them to traverse the Frozen Sea without worrying about falling into a cube. They'll still have to deal with the cubes migrating over the surface of the ice, along with other predators (Ice Mephits and Water Elementals) that fly in the skies above. They might even wake up the Elder Tempest that lives in the mountains.

## Navigating the Frozen Wastes
This will be similar to the escape from the Valley of the Crypt things. The party will have to tread carefully to avoid being snagged by the numerous frozen limbs sticking up out of the ice, but they can't go too slowly, or the skiff won't have enough momentum to cross a cube nest.

As the party clears the initial fog bank, they'll notice storm a considerable distance from shore. Any Nature or Survival check will reveal that the storm is stationary. This is the Elder Tempest.

Somewhere in the middle of the wastes, the party will be attacked by a squadron of ice mephits, water elementals, and water elemental myrmidons. If the combat drags on for too long, one of the ice mephits will fly high into the sky and detonate into a blue flare, attracting the attention of the Elder Tempest. The party will have a handful of hours before the gargantuan elemental is over them.

## The Shadow
Zeethrae's vessel is mostly intact. She lives here with 6 other drow hunters, plotting on how to overthrow Orcus. They are VERY distrustful of outsiders, usually believing them to be Orcus' agents coming to foil their plans or capture them. In truth, Orcus couldn't care less. Zeethrae and her band aren't even any annoyance.

The Shadow is a maze of booby traps, set to keep Zeethrae's crew safe. They're a paranoid bunch. They haven't actually had any intruders in nearly 100 years and haven't had any outside contact since King Ensar's soul slipped away after Orcus fought with him. Zeethrae and her crew stay towards the back of the ship, sticking to the dining area and captain's quarters.

The party can gain entrance into the ship by scaling one of 4 ice spikes jutting into it. Two of the spikes have cut holes into the main hold of the ship, one of them cut a hole into the front cargo area, and one of them juts out over the top and can be used to drop down onto the main deck of the ship.

The doors at the southern end of the upper deck that lead down into the hold are frozen shut. There is a hole cut into the wall near the south end of the hold, allowing access between the main hold and the area leading to the dining room.

### Hazards
Three gelatinous cubes wander the ship. When the party arrives, two are wandering the upper deck and one is stationary on the lower deck, blocking one of the doorways or stairways the party will try to use.

The ship is unstable, prone to shifting in the ice as it's weight distribution changes. It'll tilt and roll barrels around, potentially buldgeoning the players.

There are two treasure chests in the main hold of the ship. Both are mimics. https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16957-mimic

There is a false-floor trap in front of the hole in the wall near the south end of the hold. Stepping on this sends the victim down a chute and out the hole the anchor chain used to come out of, potentially landing in a gelatinous cube waiting in the ice outside.

All of the ballistas on the deck are rigged with a safety line. If they are moved without unattaching the safety line, they are rigged to explode.

### Meeting Zeethrae
Zeethrae and her 4 drow crew members are holed up in the captain's quarters at the rear of the ship. They're an extremely elderly bunch, all nearly 1000 years old, but still living.

Crew

* Imbros
* Geldar

Zeethrae and her crew were sucked into a maelstrom while they were exploring the ocean beyond the island of Draffnir. They actually witnessed a small portion of the war between the dragons and the celestials. The maelstrom turned out to be a portal through the planes. Zeethrae and her entire ship wound up on Thanatos in the Frozen Wastes. Zeethrae lost nearly all of her crew to the cubes under the ice. They made their way to the City of Liches, where King Ensar was already a high lord, but not yet king. A few more of her crew fell victim to the trickery of the liches before Zeethrae got an audience with Ensar. He was impressed that she managed to live through the hike across the Frozen Wastes and she impressed him with her court etiquette. She became his confidant (and possibly his wife). Ensar would send Zeethrae and her crew on errands around the plane, always careful to avoid the ire of Orcus or any of the other powers on this plane.

Ensar eventually rose as a high enough lord to claim kingship over the City of Liches. Unfortunately, the city didn't seem to care much about a king. The populace continued to live by their own rules, no matter what laws Ensar attempted to enact. Zeethrae grew dissatisfied with this, and sought a way to increase Ensar's authority. She proposed ursurping Orcus entirely by stealing his wand and casting him into the Sea of Blood.

Together, they posed as undead soldiers and snuck through Orcusgate into Everlost. There, they triggered the Death Beacon, a giant emerald whose light extends across the planes. It attracts any recently deceased or still wandering souls to Thanatos, as well as attracts all of the undead and most of the demons to it. This caused a massive flood of demons and undead to descend on Orcusgate. The flood was so overwhelming that Orcus himself came out to deal with it. While he was preoccupied with trying to control the flood, Ensar stole his wand and attempted to destroy him. It almost worked, but the wand has a mind of its own. It started leaching Ensar's essence from his skeletal body and he started becoming just another mindless undead. Zeethrae, her last 4 crew members, and Ensar were forced to flee.

Upon returning to the City of Liches, now effectively desserted thanks to the beacon, Ensar tried to rest and recover. However, the drain on Ensar's essence was not a temporary thing. The wand left a hole in Ensar's soul through which the rest of his essense slowly drained out. He eventually became another mindless skeleton, and then a simple corpse on a throne, unable to rule anything ever again.

### Zeethrae's Next Steps
Zeethrae will allow the party to take parts of the ship's hull to make their airship, so long as they leave it structurally sound. She has no illusions of getting revenge on Orcus. She might even wish good luck on Anguisa in taking him down (no one knows at this point that Anguisa has started negotiating directly with Orcus). She and her crew do harbor a hopeless desire to return to the Material Plane, but that's a dim dream.

Zeethrae might perk up a bit at the mention of Ensar's return to lucidity.

Zeethrae will provide the party with a Spell Scroll of Tenser's Floating Disk if they wonder how they're going to get the metal back. Between that, the party's carrying capacity, and the Portable Hole, they'll be able to transport enough of the stuff to build the boiler.

## Elder Tempest Again
A storm will brew outside the Shadow as the Elder Tempest comes back to visit the coast again. Zeethrae will encourage the party to rest in the Shadow before starting their harvesting operation on the ship.
