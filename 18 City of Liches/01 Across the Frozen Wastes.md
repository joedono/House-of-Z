# Across the Frozen Wastes
Zeethrae makes her home in her old pirate ship, The Shadow, which is locked in the ice of The Frozen Sea, amidst many other broken citadels and shipwrecks.

Getting across the sea is a fool's errand. The subconscious idea of this sea is what gave the rulers of Durrstaft the idea for their frozen lake executions. There are frozen skeletal limbs poking out everywhere here. The main hazard is the hundreds of gelatinous cubes that live just under the surface of the ice and slide across its surface. They form an ever-changing maze of dissolving walls.

If the party played their cards right in the City of Liches, they'll have an ice skiff that will allow them to traverse the Frozen Sea without worrying about falling into a cube. They'll still have to deal with the cubes migrating over the surface of the ice, along with other predators (Ice Mephits and Water Elementals) that fly in the skies above. They might even wake up the Elder Tempest that lives in the mountains.

## Navigating the Frozen Wastes
This will be similar to the escape from the Valley of the Crypt things. The party will have to tread carefully to avoid being snagged by the numerous frozen limbs sticking up out of the ice, but they can't go too slowly, or the skiff won't have enough momentum to cross a cube nest.

As the party clears the initial fog bank, they'll notice storm a considerable distance from shore. Any Nature or Survival check will reveal that the storm is stationary. This is the Elder Tempest.

Somewhere in the middle of the wastes, the party will be attacked by a squadron of ice mephits, water elementals, and water elemental myrmidons. If the combat drags on for too long, one of the ice mephits will fly high into the sky and detonate into a blue flare, attracting the attention of the Elder Tempest. The party will have a handful of hours before the gargantuan elemental is over them.

## The Shadow
Zeethrae's vessel is mostly intact. She lives here with 6 other drow hunters, plotting on how to overthrow Orcus. They are VERY distrustful of outsiders, usually believing them to be Orcus' agents coming to foil their plans or capture them. In truth, Orcus couldn't care less. Zeethrae and her band aren't even any annoyance.

The Shadow is a maze of booby traps, set to keep Zeethrae's crew safe. They're a paranoid bunch. They haven't actually had any intruders in nearly 100 years and haven't had any outside contact since King Ensar's soul slipped away after Orcus fought with him. Zeethrae and her crew stay towards the back of the ship, sticking to the dining area and captain's quarters.

The party can gain entrance into the ship by scaling one of 4 ice spikes jutting into it. Two of the spikes have cut holes into the main hold of the ship, one of them cut a hole into the front cargo area, and one of them juts out over the top and can be used to drop down onto the main deck of the ship.

The doors at the southern end of the upper deck that lead down into the hold are frozen shut. There is a hole cut into the wall near the south end of the hold, allowing access between the main hold and the area leading to the dining room.

### Hazards
Three gelatinous cubes wander the ship. When the party arrives, two are wandering the upper deck and one is stationary on the lower deck, blocking one of the doorways or stairways the party will try to use.

The ship is unstable, prone to shifting in the ice as it's weight distribution changes. It'll tilt and roll barrels around, potentially buldgeoning the players.

There are two treasure chests in the main hold of the ship. Both are mimics. https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16957-mimic

There is a false-floor trap in front of the hole in the wall near the south end of the hold. Stepping on this sends the victim down a chute and out the hole the anchor chain used to come out of, potentially landing in a gelatinous cube waiting in the ice outside.

All of the ballistas on the deck are rigged with a safety line. If they are moved without unattaching the safety line, they are rigged to explode.
