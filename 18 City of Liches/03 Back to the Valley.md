# Back to the Valley
Having gathered all they came to get from the City of Liches, the party sets off with a convoy of supplies to the Valley of the Crypt Things to finish Blast's Airship, and then bring the gear to the City of Zombies to outfit their army and take on Orcus.

During this journey, the party is waylaid by Anguisa and a small army of Orcus' troops. It is revealed that, since her setback at the Valley of the Crypt Things before, Anguisa abandoned her quest to raise an army and challenge Orcus directly. She instead plans to ingratiate herself into his service in the hopes of him loaning her his wand or finding an opportunity to steal it. To that end, Orcus has sent her out on a quest to find fresh powerful souls to draft into the undead army, and she knows just the adventerurs to "liberate".
