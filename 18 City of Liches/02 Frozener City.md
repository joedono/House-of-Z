# Frozener City
Upon returning from their journey out onto the Frozen Wastes, the party discovers that the City of Liches is under ice, or at least, significantly more ice than usual. It turns out that the Daemogorth Titan escaped from the hell zoo, formed a pact with Rashaan. The pact enables Rashaan to cast Tsunami, which he has been doing every day in an insane effort to make the city his prisoner. The party can try to stop him and save the city, or they can attempt to extract only King Ensar. Zeethrae and her crew will vote for the latter.

## Events
Skeletal goblin named Mug with the power to make people forget they ever saw it attempts to pickpocked the party. It possibly steals and drinks the Wish Potion, and wishes that people will remember it. If successful, the entire city will remember that they've all had something valuable stolen by this creature and quickly try to form an angry mob to go after it.

A mimic disguised as a chair is parading on top of the ice, screaming about how it's finally free from the lich household where it was forced to be furniture for 100 years.

Shard appears, the ice has layered on top of her frozen body, growing her to enormous size. She's incredibly clumsy and is accidentially destroying buildings left and right. She begs the party for help in reducing her size, likely by destroying or breaking off chunks of her body.

The party finds a household whose interior is mysteriously NOT frozen, due to what appears to be a magical artifact visible through the sheet of ice covering the doors and windows. If the party choosed to break in, they discover that it's not a magical item, but a pair of liches continuously casting Fireball in a way that just radiates heat. The sound of the ice breaking will startle whichever lich is holding the spell, causing it to explode with twice the usual power and radius. This completely destroys the house and heavily damages the party.

The church of the Elder Tempest has grown heavily. There is an active service going on, begging the tempest for its help. The attendees are ignorant of the true cause of the tsunamis, believing it to be the fault of the Daemogoth Titan, which they can do nothing about, rather than a lowly lich who pacted with it. The Tempest, since it has already visited the city once this century, won't come back at all. Perhaps a crisis of faith breaks out, with cries of "The Tempest has abandoned us!" and the church turns on itself.

## Finding the Pact Lich
The lich that is pacted to the Titan is none other than Rashaan, the lich that Fran helped in the duel with Vectimarus. Turns out he really was in the wrong during his duel with Vectimarus and really did try to cheat Vectimarus into giving him extra merchandise at no charge. Rashaan tried to scam Thrashings & Threads out of a dress outfit, and when he got caught again, he used his newfound power to drown T&T in a Tsunami spell which immediately froze over. T&T is now encased in a mount of ice, from which Rashaan has been raining down his frozen magic onto the city. Now, drunk with power, Rashaan isn't sure what to do next other than fulfill his base desire for free stuff.

Rashaan has been using the threat of the tsunami to get free stuff from various places. When the party finds him, he'll be like a dragon with his frozen horde of stuff. Nearly all of it will just be bits and baubles, as Rashaan didn't really care what he got, so long as he got stuff. He'll have a small cadre of frozen lich followers, who Rashaan constant threatens to sic his "benevolent patron" on. That's enough to keep them loyal to Rashaan, but the Titan really couldn't care less.

The Titan itself just wants to witness the City of Liches be encased in ice. It doesn't actually care for the manner of the city's destruction, and fully plans to do away with Rashaan once the city is completely covered. The party might be able to turn this to their advantage, if they can convince the Titan that they're on its side, despite leaving it to rot in the cage at the zoo. The Titan bears the entire city a grudge for imprisoning it and gawking at it in droves.

## Visiting King Ensar
The king is on his last dregs of lucidity when the party arrives. Zeethrae will have only a few minutes with her dear friend before he reverts back to a mostly inert giant skeleton. Without a source of giant essence, there's nothing the party can do. If they remember, there are a couple sources of Giant essence on the plane:
1. If the party rescued Shard, but didn't break her down to her normal size, they might be able to pull giant essence out of her giant frozen body
2. If the party took down the Daemogoth Titan, they could try to capture its essence through its blood and feed it to Ensar. That could have some personality-altering conesequences though.
3. The party could suggest that Zeethrae and her crew take Ensar to Skullmount. It's almost certain that Retaw could do something for Ensar.

If the party does nothing, Zeethrae will hold Ensar in his final moments of lucidity and bid him a tearful goodbye before casting Turn Undead and destroying him. Then she and her crew will accompany the party back to the Valley of the Crypt things, where they will volunteer to help Blast finish his airship.
