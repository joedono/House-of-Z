# Frozener City
Upon returning from their journey out onto the Frozen Wastes, the party discovers that the City of Liches is under ice, or at least, significantly more ice than usual. It turns out that the Daemogorth Titan escaped from the hell zoo, formed a pact with a lich named Pluthark. The pact enables Pluthark to cast Tsunami, which he has been doing every day in an insane effort to make the city his prisoner. The party can try to stop him and save the city, or they can attempt to extract only King Ensar. Zeethrae and her crew will vote for the latter.

## Events
Skeletal goblin named Mug with the power to make people forget they ever saw it attempts to pickpocked the party. It possibly steals and drinks the Wish Potion, and wishes that people will remember it. If successful, the entire city will remember that they've all had something valuable stolen by this creature and quickly try to form an angry mob to go after it.

A mimic disguised as a chair is parading on top of the ice, screaming about how it's finally free from the lich household where it was forced to be furniture for 100 years.

Shard appears, the ice has layered on top of her frozen body, growing her to enormous size. She's incredibly clumsy and is accidentially destroying buildings left and right. She begs the party for help in reducing her size, likely by destroying or breaking off chunks of her body.

The party finds a household whose interior is mysteriously NOT frozen, due to what appears to be a magical artifact visible through the sheet of ice covering the doors and windows. If the party choosed to break in, they discover that it's not a magical item, but a pair of liches continuously casting Fireball in a way that just radiates heat. The sound of the ice breaking will startle whichever lich is holding the spell, causing it to explode with twice the usual power and radius. This completely destroys the house and heavily damages the party.

The church of the Elder Tempest has grown heavily. There is an active service going on, begging the tempest for its help. The attendees are ignorant of the true cause of the tsunamis, believing it to be the fault of the Daemogoth Titan, which they can do nothing about, rather than a lowly lich who pacted with it. The Tempest, since it has already visited the city once this century, won't come back at all. Perhaps a crisis of faith breaks out, with cries of "The Tempest has abandoned us!" and the church turns on itself.
