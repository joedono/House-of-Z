# Attack on the River Styx
Having gathered all they came to get from the City of Liches, the party sets off with a convoy of supplies to the Valley of the Crypt Things to finish Blast's Airship, and then bring the gear to the City of Zombies to outfit their army and take on Orcus.

During this journey, the party is waylaid by Anguisa and a small army of Orcus' troops. It is revealed that, since her setback at the Valley of the Crypt Things before, Anguisa abandoned her quest to raise an army and challenge Orcus directly. She instead plans to ingratiate herself into his service in the hopes of him loaning her his wand or finding an opportunity to steal it. To that end, Orcus has sent her out on a quest to find fresh powerful souls to draft into the undead army, and she knows just the adventerurs to "liberate".

This will be the first time since coming to Thanatos that the party encounters the Ghost of Anguisa. She's targetting them specifically. She was given a ritual stone that casts Teleportation Circle once and brings a squadron of demons to her aid in capturing the "powerful souls" that have been roaming around Thanatos.

## Enemies

* https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17237-devourer

* https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16933-imp
* https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16952-marilith

Anguisa will spend most of her time flying between the mountain/hill peaks on the battlefield, flying through the mountains if things get too dicey. She'll flee if she drops below half HP.

The Devourers will hang back, not engaging in direct combat. They'll swoop forward if anyone in the party goes down and attempt to devour them to bring back to Orcus. They will flee if Anguisa does.

The Armanites, Nightmares, Imps, and Mariliths will be the primary force that directly engages with the party. The Armanites will strike out with their Lightning Lances and engage in melee when those are depleted.

## Allies
* Zeethrae and her crew, who know some magic
* Hairam the wingless Deva
* Ensar the ancient king. Lich stat block
* Shovel the quasit
* The Cult of the Tempest

Shovel and the Cult will obey the orders of their bonded party memebers, Jasper and Fran respectively. Hairam will likely engage with Anguisa initially, but she'll be able to charm him due to his brief connection with her offspring. She won't be able to convince him to turn and attack the party, but he'll be frightened of Anguisa for most of the battle. Zeethrae and her crew will circle around Ensar at the start of the fight and lob out offensive cantrips and level 1 or 2 spells initially. After 2 turns, Ensar will insist on taking to the front lines and cast Summon Construct to summon a Stone Construct. The construct will remind the party of Shard, but will not speak. Ensar will then use the normal Lich stat block for the remainder of the fight. He'll take to the front lines in glorious combat, with Zeethrae and her crew struggling to keep up.
