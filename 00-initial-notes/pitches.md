# Guild Wars
You're all newbie adventurers entering Loftran, a city of adventurers who have banded together to form guilds. Danger and excitement abound as the members of these guilds are expected to take on various jobs from surrounding countries, deal with guild rivals, and solve the problem of their guild's exiled successor.

# Stealing from the Rich
Robbing from the rich to give to the poor? Sounds like an adventure to me. You will all be contracted by a man named Mistein, to steal back precious medicine and supplies from a corrupt tyrant, but not everything will be as it seems. Mistein gives the impression of one who is on the wrong side of the law.

# Natural Disaster?
You'll be going about your day in the peaceful city of Hazelton, when ominous warning signs start appearing. Birds stop singing, the wind dies, and a low rumble starts to shake the ground. Within minutes, a great creature from beneath the earth erupts from the ground and proceeds to lay waste to the city. You might be the town's only hope of stopping it, but only if you can figure out what summoned it.

# Royal Mission
You all respond to a bounty put out by Queen Radomir, offering a reward for anyone who can bring back the captured Prince Christopher. He's been taken north, to places unknown by a person in a black cloak accompanied by a mysterious cat-like creature wreathed in flame.

# Prison Escape
All of you have been arrested for one crime or another (for those of you who are Lawful Good or something, you might have been framed). You're minding your own business, waiting for your trials, when you notice that you haven't seen the guards all day. Come to think of it, you haven't heard any human activity from your windows since the day before yesterday. Something is amiss outside. It is way too quiet.
