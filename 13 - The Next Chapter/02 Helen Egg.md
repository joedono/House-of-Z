# Helen Egg
The party received a message through Tabitha's bag of sending, that just said H... E... L... P... in scrawled letters. Helen, Tabitha's assistant, has fallen thrall to the energy being emitted by the black dragon egg that the party left with Tabitha after they "recovered" it from the Red Drakes. The egg is the sire of Viserion and Anguisa.

As a survival tactic, dragon eggs that aren't taken care of by their natural parents will emit "parenting" energy, a little like the thrall that Ash's mother was under in the third Pokemon movie.

## Backstory
Tabitha herself is too absorbed in her work to fall victim to the egg's thrall. Helen is not. Tabitha came down that morning to find Helen had submerged the egg in boiling acid, which is the proper method for nurturing and hatching the egg. Tabitha tried to stop her, but Helen manifested some aspects of black dragons, incapacitated Tabitha, trashed her alchemy shop, and fled.

## Tabitha's Shop
Tabitha's shop is wrecked. The door is off of its hinges and there is an acrid odor coming from inside. There are several onlookers but no guards yet.

Inside, the place is a patchwork of acid burns. Many of the furnishings, counters, and shelves have holes eaten through them. There's a dull *thunk* as a mace falls through the delinquent bag of sending, which is no longer suspended over a vat of acid. Tabitha is collapsed against a wall in the back room. She has acid burns and long bleeding cuts on her body.

**HAZARD:** The first player who attempts to enter the back room must make a Dex saving through, as a shelf suspended over the door gives way and threatens to spill a vial of unknown liquid on them.

### What Tabitha Knows
* Helen had been acting strangely the past few weeks, staying overnight in the store, asking questions about caustic liquids, doing her own secret experiments.
* Tabitha found Helen that afternoon, clad in hazard gear, and standing over a vat of boiling acid
* Tabitha confronted Helen about hatching the egg, when Helen's skin turned black and scaley, and a spray of acid came out of Helen's hand and hit Tabitha
* Helen chased Tabitha through her shop for a bit, before cornering her and using her newly sharp claws to incapacitate Tabitha
* Tabitha wrote three help notes and sent them through the bags of sending she could reach. One went to the players
* Tabitha doesn't think Helen had enough time to hatch the egg, as it needs to be submerged in boiling acid for at least a week before hatching, and the fact that the egg has been dormant for a while probably means it'll take even longer
* Helen stole a pair of packages that had recently arrived from Springs, Sprockets, and Servants in the Heavenly Cay. Tabitha will remember ordering a bunch of things: a new coffeemaker, several mixers, a new set of measuring beakers, a C.H.U.M., some new sets of tongs and other grippers, a supply of black powder, and a supply of miscellaneous metal filings. Helen stole the C.H.U.M.
* The only other place that would have that much acid in Loftran is the Warwick GNC, the *other* "big" apothecary/alchemist in Loftran. Warwick doesn't directly sell anything that caustic like Tabitha does, but he keeps some to use as ingredients in some of his stronger remedies.

The players are likely to pursue Helen to Warwick GNC

## On the Way
On their way to the apothecary, the party will notice a couple things about the city:
1. There are MISSING posters around that have King Samuel's likeness on them. The King of Loftran still hasn't been found
2. There is a brown cat following them. The cat is actually Pads, Shani's cat from the temple of Durrstaft, and actually King Samuel. He'll follow the players until they engage him.

## The Other Apothecary Shop
Warwick Kelleck, the owner of Warwick GNC, will be busy with some other customers when the party arrives. If the party waits until he's done, Helen will have more time to set up traps in her lair.

### What Warwick Knows
* Helen came in, a little frazzled, but seemed otherwise normal
* She had a paper list with her. She bought a bunch of things, including three gallons of acid
* Warwick was a little puzzled at that, but didn't think too much of it. Tabitha should have had more than enough acid for whatever she was doing, but she had occasionally had to go to other sources
* If the party succeeds in a CHA check, Warwick will also reveal that he seriously overcharged Helen, but she didn't bat an eye, which was a little unusual
* Warwick saw Helen leave and turn left out of his shop (north-west), which is unusual because that road leads away from the Heartswall District

Helen is headed for the sewers under the street in front of the Maple Leaves

## Following the Trail
The party can make a handful of Investigation or Survival checks to track Helen by:
* Bystanders who saw a woman matching her description heading north-west
* Small acid burns in the cobblestone
* Flecks of black scaling from the egg

If the party loses the trail, Pads will attempt to get their attention and lead them onto the path again.

The trail leads into the Maple Leaves residence building.

## Maple Leaves
Again, the residents suspect nothing. Some of them may have seen someone matching Helen's description on the ground floor, but no one really knows where she went. They all assumed she was just visiting someone.

The party can investigate the residence building as they see fit. They will be allowed to roam freely throughout the building. Nothing will be out of the ordinary on the main floor or second floor.

The players will find clues leading them to a door to the basement, which is used for storage and a cistern. This is where Helen has set up shop.

## Battle with Helen
Helen has been infused with essence of Black Dragon combined with the genius of an apprentice to the greatest alchemist in Loftran.
