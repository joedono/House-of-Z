# Helen Egg
The party received a message through Tabitha's bag of sending, that just said H... E... L... P... in scrawled letters. Helen, Tabitha's assistant, has fallen thrall to the energy being emitted by the black dragon egg that the party left with Tabitha after they "recovered" it from the Red Drakes. The egg is the sire of Viserion and Anguisa.

As a survival tactic, dragon eggs that aren't taken care of by their natural parents will emit "parenting" energy, a little like the thrall that Ash's mother was under in the third Pokemon movie.

## Backstory
Tabitha herself is too absorbed in her work to fall victim to the egg's thrall. Helen is not. Tabitha came down that morning to find Helen had submerged the egg in boiling acid, which is the proper method for nurturing and hatching the egg. Tabitha tried to stop her, but Helen manifested some aspects of black dragons, incapacitated Tabitha, trashed her alchemy shop, and fled.

## What the Players Find
Tabitha's shop is wrecked. The door is off of its hinges and there is an acrid odor coming from inside. There are several onlookers but no guards yet.

Inside, the place is a patchwork of acid burns. Many of the furnishings, counters, and shelves have holes eaten through them. There's a dull *thunk* as a mace falls through the delinquent bag of sending, which is no longer suspended over a vat of acid. Tabitha is collapsed against a wall in the back room. She has acid burns and long bleeding cuts on her body.

**HAZARD:** The first player who attempts to enter the back room must make a Dex saving through, as a shelf suspended over the door gives way and threatens to spill a vial of unknown liquid on them.

## What Tabitha Knows
* Helen had been acting strangely the past few weeks, staying overnight in the store, asking questions about caustic liquids, doing her own secret experiments.
* Tabitha found Helen that afternoon, clad in hazard gear, and standing over a vat of boiling acid
* Tabitha confronted Helen about hatching the egg, when Helen's skin turned black and scaley, and a spray of acid came out of Helen's hand and hit Tabitha
* Helen chased Tabitha through her shop for a bit, before cornering her and using her newly sharp claws to incapacitate Tabitha
* Tabitha wrote three help notes and sent them through the bags of sending she could reach. One went to the players
* Tabitha doesn't think Helen had enough time to hatch the egg, as it needs to be submerged in boiling acid for at least a week before hatching, and the fact that the egg has been dormant for a while probably means it'll take even longer
* The only other place that would have that much acid in Loftran is
