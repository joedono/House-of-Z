# Intermission
The party has a year off before the next adventure gets underway. What are they up to?

## Player Goals

### Fran
Attempts to get his lycanthropy under control. Probably accidentally eats Carl, his emotional support ox.

### Liara
Leaves to return to her temple on Mount Stratha. With her holy book in hand and her ascension to Master Cleric, she has restored her purpose in life and is ready to return home.

### Ibal
Ibal wants to learn how to use a shield, but also get more involved with the city law enforcement. He's really leaning into the Sherlock Holmes "police consultant" stereotype.

Teacher = Harold or Byron

A human and dwarf soldiers. Part of the city guard. The party meets them in the trauma ward at the Seat of War during the initial Yuan-Ti ritual. They were unaffected by the quelling effect of the sigils and their mental state is deteriorating due to them witnessing the shadows come alive and murder people.

#### Issues with Law Enforcement
* Guards will cleaning up a crime scene as soon as possible to avoid panic, meaning there is less time to examine evidence at the scene
* Guards will usually imprison multiple criminals involved in the same crime in the same or adjacent cells, leaving then an opportunity to talk before interrogation and straighten their story
* Case files are purged after sentencing, meaning that follow-up cases or repeat crimes are harder to pin down
* There are no magical employees of the city watch, meaning that the soldiers have to rely on the Wizard's College for consultation, and since there is no official position for wizard consultant, no one at the college has the depth of understanding of forensics or law to be of much use to the city watch.

### Theryn
After attending Cathlene's graduation from the Wizard's College in Loftran, Theryn finds a purpose helping the children in Loftran and elects to open a school.

### Darquin
Off training to be more experienced with his subclass

### Ardin
Go back to Konnith Forest... alone, and attempt to rebuild his home.

### Valmar
Leaves to pursue information about Anguisa. Meets his end at the hands of Garlan the Revenant (?)

## Events
The party has one year before anything super interesting happens, so here's what happens in the meantime:
* Cathlene graduates from college
* Makaria invites the party to several more parties, and talks Ibal and Theryn up to her friends
* Tabitha makes a lot of use of Ibal's experimental expertise
