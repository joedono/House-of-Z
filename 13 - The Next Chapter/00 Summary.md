# Ghostly Whispers
Viserion is dead, but the ghost of Anguisa is still out there. She still has a plan to complete.

## Goals
* Introduce the war between the dragons and the celestials
* Deal with Garlan the Revenant
* Deal with the Black Dragon Hatchling at Tabitha's
* Have Catherine graduate from the Wizard's College
* Work in "The Horror Within" module at some point
* Have Eliza Long start to contact Nell Brisly about finding her long lost daughter
* Introduce Anguisa's plan to resurrect Draffnir using his bones
* Introduce the bones as characters

## Hook
The first hook could either be the Black Dragon Hathling or the Brisley girl from *Beneath the Black Rose* manifesting her extreme sensitivity to undead and her disappearing, and Victor and Naomi coming to the players for help.
