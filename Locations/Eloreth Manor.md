# Eloreth Manor
the players received this manor from Queen Amafrey of Loftran as a reward for saving the city from the Venomers and the Yuan-Ti Transformation Ritual.

The mansion used to belong to a noble family named Eloreth, an elven family that recently abandoned their position in the city to pursue ventures in other regions in the world. It was all rather mysterious, actually. The place will be dingy, but serviceable, and with signs of a sudden departure. It'll be a lot easier to maintain with staff.

## Layout
The manor has 2 stories. It has:
- A reception hall or lobby
- 2 main bedrooms
- 1 guest bedroom
- Servant's quarters for 2
- Kitchen
- Dining Room
- Study
- Coat Room

## Secret Room
While exploring the mansion, the party will discover a door that has been locked with a 9th level Arcane Lock spell, which is currently beyond the magic of anyone in the party or the city. However, it can be opened with a password. The clues for the password are written in elvish on a piece of parchment nailed above the door.

```
Be ye friend or be ye foe?
Speak my name, or you'll never know.
Leave me a drink, or a plate of treats
and I'll keep your mansion nice and neat.
```

The required name is Pepper Orangepearl, and belongs to the brownie to lives behind the locked door in the residence. She'll only come out when the mansion is deserted, and he'll clean everything. She'll leave a clue to his name each time the party leaves out treats or a drink, leaves, and comes back. The clues will be pepper, an orange, and a pearl. Speaking the name will open the door and reveal a secret room. The room is bigger on the inside. The room has a teleportation circle that the magic users in the party can memorize the sigil sequence for, an arcane laboratory with many books, alchemical supplies, a magic item or three, and the making of the portal. This was actually what happened to the previous owner of the mansion. They opened a portal to the Abyss and disappeared through it.

## Pepper Orangepearl
The Brownie who lives in the manor. She's a fey creature who loves treats and other sweet things. Every night that the party leaves food out for her, she'll clean the manor top-to-bottom. She'll serve as a sort of poltergeist to anyone who irritates her. She'll leave the manor if people stay in the manor for over a week and don't leave her a treat, or if anyone specifically attempts to hunt for her. Brownies hate to be seen more than anything. Her attitude towards the players will change depending on their attitude towards the manor. If they vandalize things or break things without purpose, she'll become irritated. Having a fun, but messy party, in which stuff gets broken, doesn't count. Pepper will enjoy the revelry (still without being seen).
