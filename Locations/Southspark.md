# Southspark
A medium-sized town on the south edge of the world. Has never seen snow.

The people of Southspark are a hardy folk. The main export of the town are the rare ingredients and spices that grow on the Finger Peak mountains to the west. Thus, the people are mainly mountain-climbers and have a variety of different ways to travers the mountains. An intricate system of pulleys, elevators, ziplines, and stairs provide a way up. Ziplines provide the way down from the lower peaks, with hang-gliders being the vehicle of choice from the higher peaks.

## Illusory Food
Every long rest that the party spends in Southspark where they don't eat any of their own food, they must make a DC CON saving throw. On a failure, they receive one level of exhaustion and wake up really hungry. The DC starts at 10 and goes up by 3 every night that the party does not eat their own food or food they forage for themselves. The water is real, the alcohol is not.

The money is also illusory.

## Leaky Boulder
Main tavern of the town. Has a meal-of-the-day sort of menu. Has a regular band (drums, lute, and flute), but they only know one song.

## Hammer and Nails
Carpentry Supply Store and blacksmith.

## Sky Delvers
The miners guild. Situated at the western side of Southspark. Inspired by the Fairy Tail guild. Almost always full of activity in the form of people swinging from the rafters. The guild hall is a multi-story building, but there are no stairs. The members get around by swinging ropes, pulleys, elevators, and zip lines.

## Crystal Meltdown
The metal refinery. The crashing and clanking of all the machinery almost always makes a song, but the employees never notice. They just bop and bounce to the rhythm. It makes them extremely efficient.

## Temple of Innovation
Temple to Erathis, the goddess of civilization and invention. The only place where the illusion can't touch. However, it can be covered with one. When viewed from the outside, it looks like a well-kept temple, but there's no one inside. If the party enters, they'll pass through the illusion and find the interior of the temple completely packed up and deserted. There is a layer of dust on everything other than the space just inside the door. The clues all point to a calm exodus. There was no struggle. The priests all packed up calmly and left.

However, the players might see small footprints in the dust and hear scratching from downstairs. Neep lives down there.
