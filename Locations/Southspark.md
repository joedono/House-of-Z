# Southspark
A medium-sized town on the south edge of the world. Has never seen snow.

The people of Southspark are a hardy folk. The main export of the town are the rare ingredients and spices that grow on the Finger Peak mountains to the west. Thus, the people are mainly mountain-climbers and have a variety of different ways to travers the mountains. An intricate system of pulleys, elevators, ziplines, and stairs provide a way up. Ziplines provide the way down from the lower peaks, with hang-gliders being the vehicle of choice from the higher peaks.

## Illusory Food
Every long rest that the party spends in Southspark where they don't eat any of their own food, they must make a DC CON saving throw. On a failure, they receive one level of exhaustion and wake up really hungry. The DC starts at 10 and goes up by 3 every night that the party does not eat their own food or food they forage for themselves.

## Leaky Boulder
Main tavern of the town. Has a meal-of-the-day sort of menu.
