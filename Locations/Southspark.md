# Southspark
A medium-sized town on the south edge of the world. Has never seen snow.

The people of Southspark are a hardy folk. The main export of the town are the rare ingredients and spices that grow on the Finger Peak mountains to the west. Thus, the people are mainly mountain-climbers and have a variety of different ways to travers the mountains. An intricate system of pulleys, elevators, ziplines, and stairs provide a way up. Ziplines provide the way down from the lower peaks, with hang-gliders being the vehicle of choice from the higher peaks.
