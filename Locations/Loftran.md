# Loftran

Starting city, a sprawling metropolis. A land of opportunity and vice, if you know where to look and who to talk to. The players meet each other in the Hangman's Noose prison, where they've been placed while arrested.

## Summary
Think Midgar from FFVII. This city has everything. It has poor people, rich people, a thriving market, a far-reaching underworld, sewers, secret passageways, churches, banks, barbers, taverns, whore houses, blacksmiths, wizarding schools, etc. etc. etc.

## Main Industry - Hatching Stones
The convergence of worldly magical forces at this point makes the soil incredibly fertile, and promotes the formation of crystals deep underground that are well suited for magical channeling. These stones grow in unusually smooth formations, and resemble rough eggs when they are found in the rock. They are unimaginatively known as Hatching Stones. In their rough form, they can store magical energy that is emitted as light or heat. After processing, they have a variety of uses. Two twin rocks cut from the same source rock will resonate with each other, functioning as a sort of long-range radio. A rather large amount of material that goes through expensive processing can be made into something resembling a Ring of Spell Storing (variety of levels).

## Individual Locations

### Hangman's Noose
City Prison. Boasts a handful of cells, a couple of anti-magic cells, including solitary confinement, and a rotating guard schedule. Not the main prison of the city, but a good holding location for prisoners who will not be in prison very long. No life-sentences here. At the start of the story, the workers here are Malcom, Caleb, and Gorma

### House of Sunlight
Church dedicated to Pelor. Maintained and serviced by Brother Kellen and Sister Thia.

### Glistening Mines
The mines to the north of the city, where the city's Hatching Stones come from in their raw form.

### Elmwall Vineyards
The most prominent vineyard in the city. Due to the unique properties of its soil, the fruit produced here ripens twice as fast, and the wine produced by fermenting it ages in half the time. Formerly owned by Archeblad Elmwall, it has been inherited by his widow, Isabella Elmwall.

### Makaria Vineyards
The second-most-prominent vineyard in the city. Owned by Makaria. Has been suffering from a supply shortage lately due to the fruit not ripening fast enough. This is due to a Mimic Ivy infestation.

### Wizard's College
University of spellcasters. Has the largest library in Loftran. The policy here is "knowledge should be given to all who seek it," leading the students and staff to be friendly towards anyone who wants to learn...just about anything.

### Seat of War
Military headquarters of Loftran. The army barracks.

### The Bloody Tankard
Lower-middle class pub. The tavern where Fran and Theryn were arrested. Has a betting board and a fighting ring, but the ring is rarely used. Instead, fights tend to favor all-out brawls in the main pub area.

### The Emerald Glass
Higher class pub with more expensive wine, live music, and better food. Aiden the fruit and wine merchant supplies this place with most of its drink. The centerpiece of the restaurant is a green-hued crystal glass. At noon, the sun spills through a hole in the ceiling, hits the glass, and dazzles the eyes with a miracle of colored light that reflect and refract all around the tavern.

### Maple Leaves
A large residential building, like an apartment complex, located near the House of Sunlight.

### Bannow's Place
Tavern near the Hatching Stone Mines. Favorite of most miners. Wind O'Leaf frequents here after the disaster with the lift.

### Threads & Thrashings
High-end clothing store. Owned by a very fashion conscious half-orc named Neega.

### Chester's Crafting Creations
High level woodworking craftsman. Sells a variety of high quality wooden goods, including whittled trinkets.
