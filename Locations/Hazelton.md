# Hazelton
Hazelton makes its living mostly through logging. It abuts Kornith Forest, the largest forest on Loftran. The wood there grows large and strong. The community in Hazelton is very respectful of the woods and nature, despite pressures from outside to increase logging production.

## Wood 'N' Tap
Town tavern. Run by a pair of twin human sisters, Mina and Lina, and their uncle Bradford. Despite being family, Bradford cannot tell the sisters apart. They will constantly mess with him by switching places. When he addresses them by name and asks them to do something, they'll say "Okay, Uncle Brad. By the way, I'm Mina" and run off to do the task. It's exasperating, but Bradford loves them dearly.

The special here is the Charred Steak, a very good piece of steak that is served on a still-smoldering piece of wood, giving it an incredibly smoky flavor.

## Three Alters
There are three small alters just before the main path up the mountain. They are dedicated to Torm, Pelor, and Bahamut and have miniture statues of each for clerics to pray to before they start the trek up the mountain. There are also donation boxes at each alter. The boxes for Pelor and Bahamut are heavy and full but the one to Torm is almost empty. There's only a single coin in it.

## The Mill
Simply called "The Mill", it is a massive building and yard where all the equipment necessary to cut apart the massive logs and prepare them for export are. The manager is an elderly male human named Portsox. He has one arm. Lost it in a logging accident. He's a kindly old man with a soft tone, who completely transforms when he sees a safety violation or someone not being careful enough with something.

Against the wishes of Portsox, the staff of The Mill have been experimenting with using a C.H.U.M. It's actually been working out quite well, which will probably surprise the party.

## Riff's House of Hunting and Hiking
General store. Sells mostly climbing gear to people looking to scale the mountain. Also offers guides. Business is usually pretty bad because the people who scale the mountains are clerics and they take minimal equipment and no guides since it's seen as a pilgrimage. Business has been even worse lately due to supply problems. The House usually gets most of its equipment as surplus from the Sky Delvers in Southspark, which is completely gone, of course.

Run by Riff, a male human. Former denizen of Southspark but moved away several years ago.
