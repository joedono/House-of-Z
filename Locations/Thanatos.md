# Thanatos
http://thecampaign20xx.blogspot.com/2017/05/dungeons-dragons-guide-to-thanatos.html

Thanatos is the 113th layer of the Abyss (or 666th, depending on the mood). It is the realm of the undead, ruled by Orcus, the demon lord of undeath. It is bleak and inhospitable to normal life. The landscape is a rocky wasteland surrounded by a burning sea of blood, frozen wastes, and a poisonous marsh. With the passing of the day, the sky starts each morning a sickly green color, changing to bright red in the afternoon, then a dull crimson in the evening before going pitch black for the night.

Each hexagon represents a day of travel on foot.

## Locations

### The Conduit
A portal site that leads to other planes. The portal is like the base of a funnel. Many portals that lead into or through the Abyss empty out here, but it is VERY difficult to use it to escape. One is just as likely to wind up on another layer of the Abyss as where they came from unless they have some artifact tying them to their desired destination. This is where the party will wind up.

### Skullmount
A mountain 4,000 feet high made entirely of bone. It is the remains of Draffnir's brother, Olnir. It exists in a perpetual state of undeath, trying to reassemble itself. Unfortunately, there are too many other leftover bones from other creatures for it to form anything coherent or resembling Olnir. So, it forms various other things, such as a giant's fist, dinosaurs, dragons, smaller giants, ettins, and other creatures.

### Deadlands
A massive (mostly symbolic) graveyard. There are billions of gravestones here, one for every soul lost to the Abyss after death.

### City of Zombies
A city of 10,000 zombies, victims of the evil of Orcus who seek a true death. They are ruled by a zombie king - an ordinary zombie on a throne. The zombies here would team up with the heroes to take down Orcus.

### The Sea of Blood
Although Thanatos proper does not connect to the Styx throughout its entirety, the places where the blood-seas are exposed to the frigid air but have not frozen solid present their own dangers. Horrible undead monstrosities live within the blood; a physical manifestation of the death and suffering that The Goat has spread throughout Creation as he slaughtered the living. Corpse Styx dragons (Draconomicon) and far worse things that may even be older than Orcus' dominion over the layer swim within its opaque depths, bent to his will since his rise to power. In addition to the normal dangers presented by drowning in the blood, it deals 5d6 points of negative energy damage upon direct contact, and 20d6 points of negative energy damage upon full immersion (Fort save DC 60 for half damage) per round. Half of the damage inflicted by either contact or immersion is pure vile damage, and cannot be healed except upon consecrated ground. Undead creatures are immune to the Sea of Blood's power to inflict vile damage upon all other beings. Mortals that die within the Sea of Blood arise as drowned (MMIII) with full hp and equivalent HD to their original total character level, drenched in ever-dripping blood.

### The River Styx
A branch of The Styx enters Thanatos and meanders across much of its territory until finally entering the Sea of Blood about a day's travel away from Naratyr. Due to the layer's geography, normal means of Stygian travel are typically unavailable. Orcus generally despises daemons, and icing the Styx over throughout most of its course in Thanatos was an act he performed relatively soon after establishing total control over the Mausoleum of Hate. Still, in some places where the Styx flows underneath the glaciated blood and through catacomb-grottoes, rare marraenodaemons can offer at least some transport to those who can afford their rates, and piscodemons have been known to use its foul waters to spy either for those serving The Goat or for his enemies depending on who is currently offering them more wealth. The Styx is not unusually potent within Thanatos and the Will save DC in order to avoid memory loss is 25. 

### The Bone Meal Desert
A desert like any other, except the sand is powdered bone.

### The Burning Waste
A rocky hellscape full of lava lakes and geysers. Comprises the south-western border of Thanatos.

### The Valley of the Crypt Things
This place is lined with ornate thrones. On each throne its a pale, solitary skeletal being wearing a brown, hooded robe. There are 24 of them in total. They rise and point fingers at PCs.

A bewildering maze of natural defiles and canyons that eventually dip below the surface of Thanatos and connect to the Endless maze of Baphomet.

### Orcusgate
A chaotic metropolis ruled by Glyphimhor, demon lord of orcus gate. Glyphimhor wants the Wand of Orcus for himself. The city is full of dark houses, no sign of life. No light, sounds or smells. Being in the city drains levels! Every d4 hours you lose one.

This is the dwelling of demons of Orcus. There is a gate of fire that connects Thanatos to the Pits of Pazunia. The demons here demons thwart visiting skull lords, delighting in the cruelty. Bulky white-skinned winged demons known as zovvuts pass for law-enforcement here. The rulers are the Council of the Riven Ram, a six-member cabal that dictates demonic policy. The council is comprised of balors and mariliths.

### City of Liches
A great stone wall with a gate of iron. A silent, dead city. Magnificent, but cold. Ruled by “the Lich King.”

### The Plains of Hunger
This area is home to countless hordes of undead seeking flesh to consume. Skeletons, zombies, ghouls, mohrgs, hullathoins and wights. Skull Lords come here and try to take control of a horde. Sometimes the Disgraced liches take control of a horde.

Frost-rimed flatlands teeming with undead. Hundreds of skeletons, zombies and ghouls.

### The Frozen Waste
The barren rocky and icy mountains that border the north-western reach of Thanatos.

### The Frozen Sea
Ancient citadels and shipwrecks frozen in ice. One vessel, the Shadow, is home to Kiaranselee-worshiping drow who want to humble Orcus.

### Mausoleum of Icy Fear
In Naratyr, there is a cemetery whose graves are carved into the surface of a frozen ocean. The heroes exploring this place may have to battle. It is home to vrocks, vampires, bodaks and spectres.

### City of Straight Curves
A frozen-over port city whose streets bend in extra-dimensional ways. It is ruled by a nabassu named Slursidyal, who loves using illusions to mess with visitors.

### Twilight Marsh
A poisonous swampland that comprises the north-eastern border of Thanatos.

### The White Kingdom
Home to Doresain, King of the Ghouls, and thousands of ghouls.

### The Black Lake
A lake of black blood that surrounds The White Kingdom

### The Final Hills
A low mountain range composed entirely of broken and shattered headstones and filled with a series of narrow passes infamous for their sheer number and variety of incorporeal undead. Beyond the greater shadows, dread wraiths, umbral creatures (LM), crimson death mists (MMII) and other horrors residing within the Final Hills, these paths are also threatened by the Reality of Oblivion’s touch more than almost any other place in the Mausoleum of Hate. A constant stream of minor earthquakes and fumaroles from which clouds of disease-inflicting gas infused with negative energy constantly vent are the results of this influence. Any living creature which inhales these vapors, in addition to taking 6d6 points of negative energy damage per round, must also make a Fort save DC 60 or else catch life blindness (see Book of Vile Darkness). Reaching Everlost through the Final Hills typically takes three days by mortal reckoning, and living creatures that die within The Final Hills arise from the dead as greater shadows of equivalent hit die to their class levels, or as umbral creatures. 

### Everlost
A massive fortress of bones in a sprawling desert of bone meal called Oblivion's End.

Most inhabitants are intelligent undead along with demons and bodaks. Two balors guard the entrance to the throne room, a place where mortals normally aren't allowed in. The balors wear black adamantine armbands that grants them immunity to negative energy.

#### The Halls of the Risen Grave
A short tunnel that leads to the center of the palace. The dome inside is the interior of a truly gargantuan skill. At the center is a pile of skulls with a throne of black stone inlaid with mithral. This is the throne of Orcus. Strange black tendrils writhe from the black stone.

#### The Throne of Orcus
Approaching the throne is difficult. It is a negative energy conduit that drains strength. The closer you come to it, the more you feel pressed down by an unseen weight. Once within 60 feet you must save each round or be forced to your knees.

#### The Arena
The champions include fiendish death giants Lestra and Orbenet and a crawling head named Lertyck Trumbel.
