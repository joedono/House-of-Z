# Thanatos
http://thecampaign20xx.blogspot.com/2017/05/dungeons-dragons-guide-to-thanatos.html

Thanatos is the 113th layer of the Abyss (or 666th, depending on the mood). It is the realm of the undead, ruled by Orcus, the demon lord of undeath. It is bleak and inhospitable to normal life. The landscape is a rocky wasteland surrounded by a burning sea of blood, frozen wastes, and a poisonous marsh. With the passing of the day, the sky starts each morning a sickly green color, changing to bright red in the afternoon, then a dull crimson in the evening before going pitch black for the night.

Each hexagon represents a day of travel on foot.

## Locations

### The Conduit
A portal site that leads to other planes. Metaphorically, the portal is like the base of a funnel. Many portals that lead into or through the Abyss empty out here, but it is VERY difficult to use it to escape. One is just as likely to wind up on another layer of the Abyss as where they came from unless they have some artifact tying them to their desired destination. This is where the party will wind up. They will be almost immediately ambushed by scavengers that prey on fresh arrivals.

### Skullmount
A mountain 4,000 feet high made entirely of bone. It is the remains of Draffnir's brother, Retaw. It exists in a perpetual state of undeath, powered by the undeath energy that permeats this land, trying to reassemble itself. Unfortunately, there are too many other leftover bones from other creatures for it to form anything coherent or resembling Retaw. So, it forms various other things, such as a giant's fist, dinosaurs, dragons, smaller giants, ettins, and other creatures.

### Deadlands
A massive (mostly symbolic) graveyard. There are billions of gravestones here, one for every soul lost to the Abyss after death.

### City of Zombies
A city of 10,000 zombies, victims of the evil of Orcus who seek a true death. They are ruled by a zombie king - an ordinary zombie on a throne, which will turn out to be Garlan, the dragonborn member of the Red Drakes who was reborn as a Revenant. He will have let go of his vengeance, believing it to be settled. However, his soul was captured by Orcus and brought here, tortured for years (Abyss time), before escaping and eventually being made lord of the City of Zombies. Garlan will be happy to help the players, and so will all the zombies in the city.

The City of Zombies has all the trappings of a regular city. There are taverns, shops, festivals, markets, weddings, farms, maybe a little bit of industry. Nearly all of it is just appearances though. Since the zombies don't need to eat or sleep, they can't truly get drunk, and the environment of Thanatos doesn't permit anything truly nutritious to grow, most of the city industries aren't real. Taverns serve rotting meat and disgusting liquid for food and drinks. Farms grow poisonous weeds. Any zombie acting drunk is just acting. Beds are facsimilies and horribly uncomfortable to the living. Half of the zombie only feign sleep, and half of them sleep in holes in the ground.
 
There is diversity though. Many races have ended up here. Children too. There's also a mixture of speeds. Some of the zombies are shamblers and some can move normally. All are lucid and aware though. Those that aren't wander out of the city and are tended to by the Chasme, but the undead regenerative powers of the plane cause that to happen really slowly.

#### Tavern - The Shambling Alehouse
Owned by Gwen Echeverria, a formerly half-elf female who died of the plague. She's reasonably well put-together for a zombie, still retaining much of her former beauty. The tavern sells a bastardization of "lemonade" that a recent arrival brought with him. It's dirty water mixed with a little bit of the Sea of Blood and could potentially be deadly to still-living mortals. It eats through the stomachs of zombies and burns the floor. Appropriately, there are burn marks all over the floor.

#### Smithy - Blackened Steel
Owned by Bart Fireglaive, a former dwarf male who died from an infection in his arm from an accident at work. His arm has completely rotted away by now, but he manages to work the smithy with one hand. Despite his former skill, the lack of materials means the weapons he makes are brittle and shatter easily, but it's what he knows and he has nothing better to do.

#### School - Reanimation
The teacher is Edla Farcia, a formerly human female who died of old age. She teaches zombie children things they will never remember, but doesn't know what else to do with herself. She is constantly falling apart but has a supply of glue to keep things together.

#### Casino - The Golden Teeth
Owned by Duncan Willis, a formerly human male who died from wounds sustained from enforcers when he tried to run off with his winnings. The casino actually deals in body parts, with zombies betting parts of themselves to get other parts. This results in a selection of haphazardly put-together zombies that are coming apart at the seams. The party will likely not want to bet anything here, since they don't take gold. But if they insist, the available games are cards and dice.

#### Guardhouse
A number of zombie guards patrol the city, but their effectiveness is to be doubted. A slight breeze sends their bodyparts dropping to the ground due to how long most of them have been undead. The guard captain is Blaskel Stronghammer, a former dwarf. He has all the trappings of an old military blowhard and even managed to keep most of his moustach into undeath.

#### Market
Open-air market with stalls selling rotting versions of normal market wares. LOTS of rotten food and cooked meat of questionable origin.

### The Sea of Blood
A boiling sea of blood that forms Thanatos' south-eastern border. Horrible monstrosities dwell within the blood. It is a physical manifestation of death and suffering. Even touching the blood causes fire and necrotic damage to the living. Mortals that die in the blood are risen as undead (as usual) that bleed perpetually.

### The River Styx
A branch of the Styx enters Thanatos from the Twilight Marsh, branches around the Final Hills, and terminates in an unseen and unexplored part of the plane. The portion that runs through the Twilight Marsh is so poisonous that even breathing its vapor is damaging. The portion that borders the Sea of Blood is boiling. The portion that borders The Frozen Waste is frozen. The only parts of the river that are navigatable are the portions in between, where the elements mix and dwindle each other.

Surviving contact with the water itself still requires a Wisdom save to avoid memory loss or corruption.

### The Bone Meal Desert
A desert like any other, except the sand is powdered bone.

### The Burning Waste
A rocky hellscape full of lava lakes and volcanos. Comprises the south-western border of Thanatos. Past it is a sea of lava as far as the eye can see.

### The Valley of the Crypt Things
A rocky labyrinth of caves and canyons filled with previous rulers of Thanatos. Each one is little more than a semi-aware skeleton that is attempting to rebuild it's palace out of the broken rock found here. They can manifest some portion of their servant armies, warped by the energy of the plane. They are locked in an eternal cycle of rebuild, reforge, manifest, conquest, loss, rebuild again.

The labyrinth eventually leads down to an entrance to The Endless Maze, the layer of the Abyss ruled over by Baphomet.

### Orcusgate
The entrance to the easiest pass through The Final Hills and eventually to Everlost. The great gate is the most prominent feature of the chaotic metropolis known as Orcusgate. Strength rules here, and imposes some semblance of order onto the city. The city is full of broken down black dwellings that barely serve to protect from the elements. There are six great towers arranged in two rows of three and pointing toward the great gate, one for each member of the Riven Ram council.

The city is ruled over by Glyphimhor, a Balor loyal to Orcus (for now). Under him is the Council of the Riven Ram, a six-member cabal that dictates demonic policy. The council is comprised of balors and mariliths.

### City of Liches
A silent, cold, dead city situated in the mountains of The Frozen Waste. Resembles Loftran but is solely populated by liches and their servants. Has the air of a higher-class society. Ruled by the Lich King, a long dead ancestor of King Samuel of Loftran.

### The Plains of Hunger
This frost-rimed flatland is home to countless hordes of undead seeking flesh to consume. Skeletons, zombies, ghouls, and wights. Denizens of the City of Liches come here to pick apart a horde and add it to their servants.

### The Frozen Waste
The barren rocky and icy mountains that border the north-western reach of Thanatos. Beyond them is The Frozen Sea.

### The Frozen Sea
Ancient citadels and shipwrecks frozen in ice. One vessel, the Shadow, is home to Demogorgon-worshiping drow who want to overthrow Orcus.

### Mausoleum of Icy Fear
Home of oozes. The subconscious idea of this place is what gave the rulers of Durrstaft their idea for their frozen lake executions. Appears to be a portion of the Frozen Sea, but has frozen limbs poking out of it. Journeying across this place is a death sentence, as it is filled with gelatinous cubes lurking just below the ice. One wrong step, and your footing will break and you'll fall into a cube to meet an icy grave.

### City of Straight Curves
A perpetually sinking city in The Twilight Marsh whose streets bend in extra-dimensional ways. It is ruled by a marilith named Slursidyal, who loves using illusions to mess with visitors.

### Twilight Marsh
A poisonous swampland that comprises the north-eastern border of Thanatos.

### The White Kingdom
Home to Doresain, King of the Ghouls, and thousands of ghouls.

### The Black Lake
A lake of black blood that surrounds The White Kingdom

### The Final Hills
A low mountain range composed entirely of broken and shattered headstones and filled with a series of narrow passes infamous for their sheer number and variety of incorporeal undead. Beyond the greater shadows, dread wraiths, umbral creatures, crimson death mists, and other horrors residing within the Final Hills. These paths are also threatened by the Reality of Oblivion’s touch more than almost any other place in Thanatos. A constant stream of minor earthquakes and fumaroles from which clouds of disease-inflicting gas infused with negative energy constantly vent are the results of this influence. Reaching Everlost through the Final Hills typically takes three days by mortal reckoning, and living creatures that die within The Final Hills arise from the dead as greater shadows or as umbral creatures. 

### Everlost
Effectively the capital city of Thanatos, and where Orcus makes his home. A massive fortress of bones in a sprawling desert of bone meal.

Most inhabitants are intelligent undead along with demons and bodaks. Two balors guard the entrance to the throne room, a place where mortals normally aren't allowed in. The balors wear black adamantine armbands that grants them immunity to negative energy.

#### The Halls of the Risen Grave
A short tunnel that leads to the center of the palace. The dome inside is the interior of a truly gargantuan skill. At the center is a pile of skulls with a throne of black stone inlaid with mithral. This is the throne of Orcus. Strange black tendrils writhe from the black stone.

#### The Throne of Orcus
Approaching the throne is difficult. It is a negative energy conduit that drains strength. The closer you come to it, the more you feel pressed down by an unseen weight. Once within 60 feet you must save each round or be forced to your knees.

#### The Arena
The champions include fiendish death giants Lestra and Orbenet and a crawling head named Lertyck Trumbel.
