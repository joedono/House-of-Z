# Heavenly Cay
Ibal's home, which means his family is in the vicinity.

A very high-brow city of mostly elves. A lot of value is placed on the study of the world through magic. Travel between the islands is aided by magical bridges that act as moving walkways, similar to a modern airport. But those only extend around the locations immediately adjacent to the city. The city residents all take basic sailing lessons as a matter of course, although it's rare for a citizen to take sailor as an actual profession. They're necessary and not really looked down upon, but it's seen as a bit of a dead-end job since it doesn't offer a path to enlightenment.

## Ivory Tower
The premiere magical academy in this world. The Wizard's College in Loftran is second, but both will tell you they are the best. While the Wizard's College is an advocate for "everyone deserves knowledge", The Ivory Tower is much snobbier about who they teach, requiring that you demonstrate significant potential in magical studies in order to be granted privileges and access and stuff. The Heavenly Cay is a geniocracy, rule by the intelligent. This means that the headmaster of the Ivory Tower and his advisers also serve as the ruling body for the Heavenly Cay as a whole.

The whole neighborhood is going to be very similar to Hogwarts and the various magical areas presented in the books.
