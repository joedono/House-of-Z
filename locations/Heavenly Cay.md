# Heavenly Cay
Ibal's home, which means his family is in the vicinity.

A very high-brow city of mostly elves. A lot of value is placed on the study of the world through magic. Travel between the islands is aided by magical bridges that act as moving walkways, similar to a modern airport. But those only extend around the locations immediately adjacent to the city. The city residents all take basic sailing lessons as a matter of course, although it's rare for a citizen to take sailor as an actual profession. They're necessary and not really looked down upon, but it's seen as a bit of a dead-end job since it doesn't offer a path to enlightenment.

Religion and "natural" magic aren't really a big thing here. Similar to the attitude presented at the Wizard's College, druids, sorcerors, and warlocks are viewed as using a "dirty" form of magic, with warlocks being the worst looked upon. Divine magic is tolerated, especially by hospitals, but is still seen as inferior to the study of "real" magic and it's applications.

Nearly the entire population of the Heavenly Cay has some magical talent. Most don't get past knowing a cantrip or two. Prestigitation and Mage Hand are the most common, with Light, Mending, Message, Gust, and Dancing Lights being slightly less so. Children will often be seen playing telekinetic games with balls and other objects in the street. New arrivals are greeted by a mystical apparition that takes down their names, purpose, and evaluates them for magical aptitude. No one is barred entry based on their lack of magical aptitude, but they will be denied citizenship if they attempt to pursue it.

## Enlightenment District
Probably the most active district. This area is home to the Ivory Tower, which also makes it the seat of the ruling class of The Heavenly Cay. This is also where the main port of the city is, so it's where the common markets and trade guilds are situated. Also the taverns and inns. The population here is the most magically talented in the city.

### Ivory Tower
The premiere magical academy in this world. The Wizard's College in Loftran is second, but both will tell you they are the best. While the Wizard's College is an advocate for "everyone deserves knowledge", The Ivory Tower is much snobbier about who they teach, requiring that you demonstrate significant potential in magical studies in order to be granted privileges and access and stuff. The Heavenly Cay is a geniocracy, rule by the intelligent. This means that the headmaster of the Ivory Tower and his advisers also serve as the ruling body for the Heavenly Cay as a whole.

The whole neighborhood is going to be very similar to Hogwarts and the various magical areas presented in the books. Ibal's sister, Allannia, and Professor Adran Galanodel work here.

## Gilded Circle
The artificer's and manufacturing district. Most of the work here is automated, but they still need builders of a sort, so this district mostly resembles a "normal" city with a variety of races wandering around. It has the majority of the residential buildings. The population here is the least magically talented in the city.

Ibal's family lives here, being mostly made up of artificers. They effectively own a clockwork mansion, with conveyer belts and elevators ready to take you anywhere in the dwelling or deliver anything to you.

## Wingtop District
Effectively a pleasure district. There is a secondary port in this district.
