# Durrstaft
Mainly a dwarvish city, nestled in the high Durrstaft mountains. The general attitude of the citizens is similar to Ishgard. they believe themselves at least slightly superior to everyone else, that their beliefs are true and most others are false. Mountain Dwarves > Everyone Else.

The bulk of the city is on top of a plateau, with a wide main road leading up a series of switchbacks up the mountain to the south gate of the city. There are dwellings built on ledges and caves on the mountainsides to the east and west of the main city. A semi-complex network of caves joins these dwellings to the main city. The main gate of the city is set inside a massive stone wall that stretches around the plateau. There is a south gate that leads down the mountain towards Loftran, and a north gate that leads down a road towards a small port down on the northern sea. There is a cave that leads down to Cube Lake to the west of the city, among the other caves that lead to dwellings and other houses. The lake can be seen from sections of the southern road. Obviously, that cave entrance is guarded heavily.

Durrstaft is not a very magical city, as opposed to Loftran or The Heavenly Cay. There will be general stores, armorers, blacksmiths, inns, taverns, apothecaries (maybe), and temples, but almost no magic shops, potion sellers, formal educational buildings, or any of the more "off beat" shops, like trinket shops, fashion shops, or jewelry shops.

The people of Durrstaft aren't very welcoming to outsiders. They don't like smalltalk or pleasantries and aren't likely to help outsiders with anything other than direct transactions ("what business do ye have with me?"). If asked for directions, the natives are likely to refuse and throw in an insult such as, "ye've got eyes, haven't ye? Find it yerself."

The guards are especially suspicious of anyone mentioning dragons or other extremely large threats. They suppress all mention of such creatures in the name of preserving the peace and quickly arrest anyone who speaks of them.

## Execution
Durrstaft has a couple creative methods for executing people, both of which wind up being spectacles for those in attendance. The party will encounter several victims of Ice Poisoning en route and witness a Cube Lake execution in progress when they arrive.

### Ice Poisoning
Durrstaft has a silver dragon imprisoned beneath the castle. It has been genetically modified to have a more powerful Cold Breath attack, that actually changes flesh into ice instead of just freezing it. It's also had Feeblemind cast on it, and it's fitted with a controlling collar. Now a relatively mindless beast under control of the city guard, the dragon is carted out and put into a large bunker with the victim. The dragon is made to freeze the victim into ice.

### Cube Lake
There is a man-made frozen lake just outside Durrstaft. The lake is infested with gelatinous ice cubes, hidden just below the surface. The victim is set up on one side of the lake, with a team of archers behind them. They are told that if they can make it to the other side of the lake, they'll be allowed to live. The archers start firing and the victim starts running. Inevitably, the person either gets hit with an arrow, or they step on a cube, fall in, and are digested.

## Temples

### Temple of Torm
One of two major temples in Durrstaft. Run by Master Nathan Sarnol. Actually a small temple that serves as little more than a staging site for the pilgrimage the clerics take to the *real* temple down a secret path to the north-east.

### Temple of Eldath
The other major temple in Durrstaft. Run by zealots who are the source of the suppression of knowledge of threats in the name of "keeping the peace." Eldath is **not** happy with the people running this temple.
