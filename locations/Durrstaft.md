# Durrstaft
Mainly a dwarvish city, nestled in the high Durrstaft mountains. The general attitude of the citizens is similar to Ishgard. they believe themselves at least slightly superior to everyone else, that their beliefs are true and most others are false. Mountain Dwarves > Everyone Else.

## Execution
Durrstaft has a couple creative methods for executing people, both of which wind up being spectacles for those in attendance. The party will encounter several victims of Ice Poisoning en route and witness a Cube Lake execution in progress when they arrive.

### Ice Poisoning
Durrstaft has a silver dragon imprisoned beneath the castle. It has been genetically modified to have a more powerful Cold Breath attack, that actually changes flesh into ice instead of just freezing it. It's also had Feeblemind cast on it, and it's fitted with a controlling collar. Now a relatively mindless beast under control of the city guard, the dragon is carted out and put into a large bunker with the victim. The dragon is made to freeze the victim into ice.

### Cube Lake
There is a man-made frozen lake just outside Durrstaft. The lake is infested with gelatinous ice cubes, hidden just below the surface. The victim is set up on one side of the lake, with a team of archers behind them. They are told that if they can make it to the other side of the lake, they'll be allowed to live. The archers start firing and the victim starts running. Inevitably, the person either gets hit with an arrow, or they step on a cube, fall in, and are digested.
