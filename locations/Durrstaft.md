# Durrstaft
Mainly a dwarvish city, nestled in the high Durrstaft mountains. The general attitude of the citizens is similar to Ishgard. they believe themselves at least slightly superior to everyone else, that their beliefs are true and most others are false. Mountain Dwarves > Everyone Else.

## Execution
Durrstaft has a couple creative methods for executing people, both of which wind up being spectacles for those in attendance. The party will encounter several victims of Ice Poisoning en route and witness a Cube Lake execution in progress when they arrive.

### Ice Poisoning
Every citizen of Durrstaft is given an amulet to show that they passed muster and are allowed into the city. Those without these amulets are considered second-class citizens, but almost everyone has them. Unbeknownst to everyone except the upper ruling class, these amulets curse the wearer, causing them to turn into ice when they are killed, unable to be revived.

This method of execution is just forcing the victim to wear one of these amulets when they are killed. Their corpse is turned to ice and cannot be thawed without removing the amulet, which is usually encased in the ice.

### Cube Lake
There is a man-made frozen lake just outside Durrstaft. The lake is infested with gelatinous ice cubes, hidden just below the surface. The victim is set up on one side of the lake, with a team of archers behind them. They are told that if they can make it to the other side of the lake, they'll be allowed to live. The archers start firing and the victim starts running. Inevitably, the person either gets hit with an arrow, or they step on a cube, fall in, and are digested.
