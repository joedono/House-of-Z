# Frost Friends
-- BOOKMARK --
Once the party gets back to Loftran, they're next step will be to scale the mountains to get to Durrstaft. It's been 50-60 days since the party defeated Katarina Tsolka, and the party left the Snow Mutant alive. It's been busy.

## Snow Mutant
Alone and broken, the Snow Mutant sadly roamed through the Durrstaft mountains, barely finding enough food to survive. At the lowest point of its misery, a Bheur Hag found it. The hag felt something akin to sympathy for the poor creature, and nursed it back to health. Together, they delighted in taking revenge on any humanoids who journeyed through Frostfall Pass. The hag grew her herd by resurrecting several skeletal owlbears that the Snow Mutant feasted on, including the blind one that the party saved from the snow apes. It has scratch marks on the skull around its eye sockets.

A hiking party fell victim to the Hag and the Mutant, but while the hag was in the middle of feasting, one of the humans sat up. It had become possessed by the spirit of Garlan, the druid of the Red Drakes. Garlan's hatred for dragon-kind and gruesome death at the hands of Valmar/Liara/Anguisa have turned him into a Revenant, bent on revenge against Valmar/Liara. Garlan was all set to trek out to the Heavenly Cay to find Valmar, when he noticed that Valmar was coming closer to him. Garlan fell in with the Bheur Hag and now waits for Valmar/Liara to come to him.

Being a Revenant, any checks made to convince Garlan that his vengeance is misplaced will automatically fail. He is convinced that Valmar/Liara was the one who killed him, despite them being possessed by Anguisa at the time.

Since their last encounter, the Snow Mutant has had a sack of oil grafted onto it's back, granting it a Fire Breath ability:
**Fire Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).** The creature exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Starting the Fight
Up until this point, the weather has been perfectly clear, making the climb up relatively easy. As the party crosses through the pass, the hag will cast Control Weather, and summon a blizzard.
* Visibility is reduced to 15ft
* Creatures not under a tree take 1d6 bludgeoning damage at the beginning of their turn
