# Durrstaft
Viserion has hidden himself in Durrstaft and is making plans and gathering supplies and information that will get him and his cargo to temple of Thorm, the site of Anguisa's final battle. The party has to locate him and potentially stop him from casting True Resurrection to bring her back.

## The Road
The road leading to the front gate of Durrstaft is littered with the frozen bodies of people who've been executed. The party is likely to at least notice a hand, foot, or head that isn't entirely buried. They might even full-on trip over one.

## Arrival
At some point early in the party's arrival, they will be accosted by the guard for their name and business. They won't be let in unless they can offer to be a productive member of the Durrstaft community. The guards won't believe any talk of dragons, because Viserion was in disguise when he arrived and to doubt the word of the city guard is a punishable offense. If the party insists, they're likely to be arrested for fear mongering.

If they manage to come up with a more legitimate reason to be let in, they'll be given a citizen's amulet each, which must be worn at all times. It'll effectively function as the party's "papers" and let other guards know that they're honored citizens of Durrstaft.

On their way past the front gate, the party will be able to see a man-made lake down and in the distance. As they watch, they'll see a figure take off running across the lake. A DC 15 Perception check will reveal that the person is running from a hail of arrows being fired from out of view. After a bit of time, the figure will vanish as they fall into the ice. The party won't know this, but the lake is littered with gelatinous cubes, just under the ice. That person is not coming back up.
