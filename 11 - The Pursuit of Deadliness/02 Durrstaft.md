# Durrstaft
Viserion has hidden himself in Durrstaft and is making plans and gathering supplies and information that will get him and his cargo to temple of Torm, the site of Anguisa's final battle.

## Goal
To locate Viserion and steal/destroy the ingredients he has in order to perform True Resurrection on Anguisa.

The party has a couple options for doing this:
1. Locating the Temple of Torm in the wilderness outside of Durrstaft and laying an ambush for Viserion
2. Locating Viserion within the city

## Viserion
Viserion fell in with a caravan coming from Lindenvale. He murdered a female human cleric named Shani Longspotter while she was alone and shapeshifted into her.
* The Torm religious text wasn't all that suspicious, although he's been keeping that away from other Torm clerics, since they'd recognize how rare the text is.
* Fangs is now a cat (now named Pads).
* Anguisa's stone is an artifact charged with divine energy that Shani is taking to be identified by the master clerics of Torm at the hidden temple.

Unfortunately, Viserion doesn't have a whole lot of religious knowledge of Torm customs, prayers, or rituals. His story will quickly fall apart under scrutiny. It's just that no one asked any further questions, since they already knew Shani in the caravan and the guards in Durrstaft didn't really care.

## The Road
The road leading to the front gate of Durrstaft is littered with the frozen bodies of people who've been executed. The party is likely to at least notice a hand, foot, or head that isn't entirely buried. They might even full-on trip over one.

## Arrival
As the party approaches the gate, they will be accosted by the guard for their name and business. They won't be let in unless they can offer to be a productive member of the Durrstaft community. The guards won't believe any talk of dragons, because Viserion was in disguise when he arrived and doubting the word of the city guard is a punishable offense. If the party insists, they're likely to be arrested for fear mongering.

If they manage to come up with a more legitimate reason to be let in, they'll be allowed into the city, but warned to stay out of trouble.

On their way past the front gate, the party will be able to see a man-made lake down and in the distance. As they watch, they'll see a figure take off running across the lake. A DC 15 Perception check will reveal that the person is running from a hail of arrows being fired from out of view. After a bit of time, the figure will vanish as they fall into the ice. The party won't know this, but the lake is littered with gelatinous cubes, just under the ice. That person is not coming back up.

## Arrested
If the party makes a big stink about Viserion, they'll be arrested and put in prison. They've been "disappeared" and will face a quiet banishment out on the northern peaks. Their only choices at that point will either be to hike back to Durrstaft across the mountains, or go to the small port and try to charter passage to Lindenvale.

If the party doesn't free themselves, they'll be visited by Durin Ironfist, a VERY old friend of Fran's and effectively a leader of an underground resistance. Durin will be able, with a bit of planning, get Fran out of jail. As a favor to a friend, Durin will ask the party for help with the resistance's latest mission: to discover how the guards freeze people and somehow disrupt their methods. Durin knows that the method is a Feebleminded Adult Silver Dragon, but won't tell the party that unless convinced or threatened.

## Temple of Torm
-- BOOKMARK --
There is a temple to Torm within Durrstaft. The head cleric there is Master Nathan Sarnol. If the party asks about any upcoming pilgrimages, Nathan will tell them that the last cleric who would have been eligible disappeared almost two months ago, and the next group of graduates wouldn't be ready for another year. That missing cleric was Liara, of course. The party won't really have any way to prove that Liara is who she says she is. If she comes forward right in front of Nathan, he'll see the obvious Hat of Disguise and assume a cheap ruse. The party will have to find another way to get information on the hidden temple.

Other Clerics
* Shani Longspotter - An acolyte from Lindenvale. Viserion in disguise.
* Jarrek Bestalt - Human male acolyte. 14 years old. The newest member of the clergy. Wide-eyed and very innocent. His parents sent him to the church to learn an occupation, but he doesn't know that they were executed as heretics, frozen, and are displayed on the road to Durrstaft.
* Marloth Sethran - Female dwarf cleric. Around 120 years old. Only one year away from her full clergyship. Second in command to Master Nathan. Very motherly, but not blind to the corruption in the city. She'll be apologetic, but also refuse to help the party find the temple.
* Eberk, Travok, and Harbek Battlehammer - Male dwarven acolytes. Triplets who are always seen together.
* Gunnolda Frostbeard - A distant cousin of Baern Frostbeard of Loftran. 72 years old. She doesn't particularly want to be here, but another cleric of Torm gave his life to save her, so she feels obligated to fulfill his duties.
* Alistor Grassroot - A male dwarf. Actually a silver dragon in disguise (his marker is gray hair at his temples that roughly looks like wings). Is looking for a way to free his sister, Sophil, the silver dragon that Durrstaft uses for its executions. Maintains a facade of being WAY too excited to be a cleric.

### Free my Sister
Alistor will approach the party after they fail with Master Nathan. He'll say that he can help the party get the location of the temple, but they have to help him locate his sister first. He knows that she was last heard from entering this city, and he suspects that she was arrested. He's been going to every execution, but hasn't seen her come out. He suspects that she's still in the prison, or managed to escape somehow.

This is all a ruse. His sister is Sophil, the Feebleminded adult silver dragon that Durrstaft uses in the half of its executions that don't take part on the Gelatinous Cube Ice Lake. Alistor's goal is to get the party into the prison, down to the "special prisoner quarters", which is actually the giant holding pen for Sophil.
