# Durrstaft
Viserion has hidden himself in Durrstaft and is making plans and gathering supplies and information that will get him and his cargo to temple of Thorm, the site of Anguisa's final battle.

## Goal
To locate Viserion and steal/destroy the ingredients he has in order to perform True Resurrection on Anguisa.

The party has a couple options for doing this:
1. Locating the Temple of Thorm in the wilderness outside of Durrstaft and laying an ambush for Viserion
2. Locating Viserion within the city

## Viserion
Viserion fell in with a caravan coming from Lindenvale. He murdered a female human cleric named Shani Longspotter while she was alone and shapeshifted into her.
* The Thorm religious text wasn't all that suspicious, although he's been keeping that away from other Thorm clerics, since they'd recognize how rare the text is.
* Fangs is now a cat (still named Fangs).
* Anguisa's stone is an artifact charged with divine energy that Shani is taking to be identified by the master clerics of Thorm at the hidden temple.

Unfortunately, Viserion doesn't have a whole lot of religious knowledge of Thorm customs, prayers, or rituals. His story will quickly fall apart under scrutiny. It's just that no one asked any further questions, since they already knew Shani in the caravan and the guards in Durrstaft didn't really care.

## The Road
The road leading to the front gate of Durrstaft is littered with the frozen bodies of people who've been executed. The party is likely to at least notice a hand, foot, or head that isn't entirely buried. They might even full-on trip over one.

## Arrival
As the party approaches the gate, they will be accosted by the guard for their name and business. They won't be let in unless they can offer to be a productive member of the Durrstaft community. The guards won't believe any talk of dragons, because Viserion was in disguise when he arrived and doubting the word of the city guard is a punishable offense. If the party insists, they're likely to be arrested for fear mongering.

If they manage to come up with a more legitimate reason to be let in, they'll be given a citizen's amulet each, which must be worn at all times. It'll effectively function as the party's "papers" and let other guards know that they're honored citizens of Durrstaft.

On their way past the front gate, the party will be able to see a man-made lake down and in the distance. As they watch, they'll see a figure take off running across the lake. A DC 15 Perception check will reveal that the person is running from a hail of arrows being fired from out of view. After a bit of time, the figure will vanish as they fall into the ice. The party won't know this, but the lake is littered with gelatinous cubes, just under the ice. That person is not coming back up.

## Temple of Thorm
There is a temple to Thorm within Durrstaft. The head cleric there is Master Nathan Sarnol. If the party asks about any upcoming pilgrimages, Nathan will tell them that the last cleric who would have been eligible disappeared almost two months ago, and the next group of graduates wouldn't be ready for another year. That missing cleric was Liara, of course. The party won't really have any way to prove that Liara is who she says she is. If she comes forward right in front of Nathan, he'll see the obvious Hat of Disguise and assume a cheap ruse. The party will have to find another way to get information on the hidden temple.

Other Clerics
* Shani Longspotter - An acolyte from Lindenvale. Viserion in disguise.
* Jarrek Bestalt - Human male acolyte. 14 years old. The newest member of the clergy. Wide-eyed and very innocent. His parents sent him to the church to learn an occupation, but he doesn't know that they were executed as heretics.
* Marloth Sethran - Female dwarf cleric. Around 120 years old. Only one year away from her full clergyship. Second in command to Master Nathan. Very motherly, but not blind to the corruption in the city.
* Eberk, Travok, and Harbek Battlehammer - Male dwarven acolytes. Triplets who are always seen together.
* Gunnolda Frostbeard - A distant cousin of Baern Frostbeard of Loftran. 72 years old. She doesn't particularlly want to be here, but another cleric of Thorm gave his life to save her, so she feels obligated to fulfill his duties.
* Alistor Grassroot - A male halfling. Actually a silver dragon in disguise. WAY too excited to be a cleric.
