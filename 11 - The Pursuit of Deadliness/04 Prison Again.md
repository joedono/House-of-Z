# Prison Again
The party has made it through the Gnoll Caves or gotten arrested or otherwise gotten into the Durrstaft Prison. Their next goal is to locate and gain access to the section for "special" prisoners, where Alistor's sister, Sophil, is alledgedly being held. It's possible that the party already knows at this point that Sophil and Alistor are silver dragons.

## Failure
If the party gets caught and subdued, then they'll be sent into the Ice Pit to fight against Sophil, the feebleminded silver dragon. Durin will be able to smuggle the party's weapons into the arena, so they at least have a fighting chance. It's still going to take some good tactics to take down an Adult Silver Dragon.

The arena is open on top and exposed to the sky. A successful Perception check will reveal that Sophil is wearing a magical collar and that it is being fed magical energy by four blue crystals embedded in the walls of the arena. A successful Arcana check will reveal that the crystals are channeling a powerful Earthbind spell into the collar, preventing the dragon from flying at all.

Each crystal has 100hp and destroying three of them will prevent them from refreshing the Earthbind spell. The collar has an AC of 19 and players roll to hit it with disadvantage. It has 100hp. Any AOE spells that encompass the dragon also damage the collar. The collar automatically fails all saving throws. Destroying it will also free the dragon from the Earthbind spell.

After the fight, guards will descend on the arena, but Durin will appear and say he has a way out. He'll lead the party back into the prison and through the wall (which Durin has dismantled) into the gnoll caves. Durin will then cast Minor Illusion to make the wall appear to still be there, giving the party precious time to escape through the caves.

## Prison - Upper Level

Most of the guards are Veterans, with the two head guards being Champions. Some are still Guards, as needed.

While in humanoid form, Alistor has stats identical to Kellen.

## Prison - Lower Level
Contrary to popular belief, there are no "special" prisoners. The Lower Level of the prison only serves as Sophil's holding facility.

Like the main arena, there will be four crystals around the arena that are continually casting Hold Monster on Sophil through her collar. There will be special forces guards down here, including at least one wizard, for the party to contend with.
-- BOOKMARK --
Once the party frees Sophil, it'll take a little while for Alistor to get her under control. She'll go wild and attack anyone except Alistor until he successfully makes a Persuasion check to convince her that the party mean to help her.
