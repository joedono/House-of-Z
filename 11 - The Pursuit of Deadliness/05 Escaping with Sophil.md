# Escaping with Sophil
The party have dispatched Sophil's guards and freed her from the Hold Monster spell that's been keeping her in place. Now that have to get her out of the city. She can't shapechange while under the Feeblemind spell, so they have to find another way out.

## Opening the Door
The party now has to contend with getting her out. Since she's under the effect of a Feeblemind spell, she won't be able to change shape. There will actually be a large door that leads to the execution arena, but the party has to open it.

If the enemy wizard is still alive, he can be threatened with the solution to the lock on the large door. If not, the party will have to figure it out for themselves.

### Sophil Door Puzzle
The door is your typical partnered-lock mechanism. Opening it requires two keys turned in locks on opposite sides of the room at the same time as well as an elemental spell cast into a crystal.

**Note:** Attempting to use the Chime of Opening will cause one of the locks to open. Using it again will cause the second one to open, which will cause the other one to close. This could be a hint to the mechanism, but it means that a single Chime of Opening will not open the door. Although they could open the door with one key and the Chime of Opening.

One key can be found by searching the guards. The other can be found in the adjoining office. The crystal will remind the party of the Hatching Stones required to enter the Forbidden Section of the Wizard's College Library. This one will be glowing white currently, a signal that it's set to respond to radiant energy (although the party might mistake it for cold).

## Execution Arena
-- BOOKMARK --
If the party freed Sophil by destroying the crystals, then the ones out here will activate her collar and cast Earthbind, preventing her from flying away, and alerting more guards from within the prison, sparking another fight in the arena. This time, Sophil is 100% on the party's side and will help them so long as she is Earthbound. Out here, Alistor also has enough room to maneuver and will resume his adult silver dragon form to aid in the battle.

Each crystal has 100hp and destroying three of them will prevent them from refreshing the Earthbind spell. The collar has an AC of 19 and players roll to hit it with disadvantage due to Sophil being not at all coorporative. It also has 100hp. Any AOE spells that encompass the dragon also damage the collar. The collar automatically fails all saving throws. Destroying it will also free the dragon from the Earthbind spell.

If the party disables the Earthbind spell, Alistor will prompt them to climb on his back and he'll fly them away from here. Sophil will be too weak to fly too far, so Alistor will insist on settling down in a remote part of the mountains where they won't be disturbed.

## Epilogue
Sophil's Feeblemind spell still has another 25 days at least before it *might* wear off. Alistor will refuse to leave her alone to accompany the party. However, he does know the location of the secret temple of Torm and can describe how to get there to the party. He knows that there's no people stationed at the hidden temple, only that it has many divine seals, traps, and other methods of proving one's mettle. He'll also describe how to get back to the city. Finally, he'll warn them not to trust all the clerics of Torm. He can't put his finger on which one, but Alistor felt a presence among them while he was with them.

Worn out from so many battles, the party is likely to take a long rest in the mountains. Getting back to the city will be a decent hike, but manageable. The party might have something weird to contend with when they have to sign in to the city again.
