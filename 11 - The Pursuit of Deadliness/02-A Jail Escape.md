# Jail Escape
If the characters insist on alerting the authorities about Viserion, they'll be arrested and scheduled for execution. Durin Ironfist, a friend of Fran, will be able to smuggle them out, but it'll take some doing.

## Escape
Durin will tell the party that there's a specific section of the prison that abuts against a series of tunnels that leads out onto the face of the mountain. Once out there, it's an easy climb back into the city. Getting there is a bit of a problem. The party's gear is just down the hall in a locked vault. Durin can get the party some thieves' tools to hopefully make that job easier, or they can sneak around trying to locate the guard with the keys.

### The Prison

Most of the guards are Veterans, with the two head guards being Champions.

### The Caves

The caves are (of course) populated with a small band of Gnolls with pets:

Maybe add some spellcasting to some of these monsters to make them more threatening.

## Failure
If the party fails to escape or gets caught again, then they'll be sent into the Ice Pit to fight against Sophil, the feebleminded silver dragon. Durin will be able to smuggle the party's weapons into the arena, so they at least have a fighting chance. It's still going to take some good tactics to take down an Adult Silver Dragon.

The arena is open on top and exposed to the sky. A successful Perception check will reveal that Sophil is wearing a magical collar and that it is being fed magical energy by four blue crystals embedded in the walls of the arena. A successful Arcana check will reveal that the crystals are channeling a powerful Earthbind spell into the collar, preventing the dragon from flying at all.

Each crystal has 100hp and destroying three of them will prevent them from refreshing the Earthbind spell.
The collar has an AC of 19 and players roll to hit it with disadvantage. It has 100hp. Any AOE spells that encompass the dragon also damage the collar. The collar automatically fails all saving throws. Destroying it will also free the dragon from the Earthbind spell.

After the fight, guards will descend on the arena, but Durin will appear and say he has a way out. He'll lead the party back into the prison and through the wall (which Durin has dismantled) into the gnoll caves. Durin will then cast Minor Illusion to make the wall appear to still be there, giving the party precious time to escape through the caves.
