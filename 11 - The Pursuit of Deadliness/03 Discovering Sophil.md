# Discovering Sophil
If the party made it into the city without being arrested, they'll likely visit the Temple of Torm and receive this quest from Alistor, a young cleric that is actually an Adult Silver Dragon in disguise. Sophil is his sister.

If the party was arrested because they wouldn't stop shouting about dragons, they'll receive this quest from Durin Ironfist after they successfully escape prison.

If the party was arrested and failed to escape, they'll skip this quest because they'll fight Sophil as part of their execution.

## Gathering Information
If the party inquires about the executions, Alistor will tell them they only need to wait a day, as there is an execution scheduled for tomorrow. They can attend, and witness a brutal execution of several nameless prisoners by silver dragon breath. Alistor will reveal that they want the party's help freeing the silver dragon.

Alistor will admit that he doesn't know where to start, only that holding the dragon like this is wrong. He'll have heard of the two previous failed revolutions and suggest that the party attempt to seek out remnants of those forces that might still have some fight in them. This will lead the party to Mr Smith, the town blacksmith shop, where the owner, Durin Ironfist, is one such revolutionary and good friend of Fran.
