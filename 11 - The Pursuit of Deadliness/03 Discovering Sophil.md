# Finding Sophil
If the party made it into the city without being arrested, they'll likely visit the Temple of Torm and receive this quest from Alistor, a young cleric that is actually an Adult Silver Dragon in disguise. Sophil is his sister.

If the party was arrested because they wouldn't stop shouting about dragons, they'll receive this quest from Durin Ironfist after they successfully escape prison.

If the party was arrested and failed to escape, they'll skip this quest because they'll fight Sophil as part of their execution.

## Alistor Accompanied
No matter what plan the party decides on, Alistor will insist on accompanying them somehow. He'll be worried that his sister won't trust anyone she doesn't know after having been down there for so long, and he'll worry that she thinks he's abandoned her.

## Gathering Information
If the party inquires about the executions, Alistor will tell them they only need to wait a day or two, as there is an execution scheduled soon. They can attend, and witness a brutal execution of several nameless prisoners by silver dragon breath. With a successful insight check, the party can notice Alistor staring at the dragon.

Once the party has floundered a little trying to come up with a plan, Alistor will remember Mr Smith, the town blacksmith, has been around a long time and hates the government. He might know something that can help the party.

## Mr Smith
The blacksmith shop is owned by Durin Ironfist, a former revolutionary and good childhood friend of Fran. Durin might have some ideas for how to get access to the deeper part of the prison. He at least knows of a way to smuggle gear into the prison through the old Gnoll caves (long abandoned). But he doesn't really know anything about the "special" cells or how to get to them.

## Get Arrested
The party could just commit a grievous crime to get arrested, but then they'll be without their gear in a prison without any recourse. If this happens, Alistor might be able to smuggle something to them to help them break out.

## Gnoll Caves
If the party opts to use the Gnoll Caves to sneak into the prison, Alistor will insist on accompanying them. Durin will be able to show the party the entrance. It's a short hike outside the city and around a hidden path along the cliff to the east. The path overlooks the frozen lake and is very narrow.

Once inside, the party is likely to run into Gnoll resistance before getting to the prison.

The caves are (of course) populated with misc other creatures that moved in after the Gnolls were cleared out:

### Abandoned Gnoll Camp
In the lower-left cave on the map, the party can find the remains of the abandoned Gnoll Camp. It's mostly rags, broken wood, and frozen leather scraps. A DC 15 Perception/Investigation check will reveal a small alcove hidden behind a rock in the wall that contains:
* 200gp
* Potion of Climbing x2
* Potion of Healing x3
* Spell Scroll (Faerie Fire)
