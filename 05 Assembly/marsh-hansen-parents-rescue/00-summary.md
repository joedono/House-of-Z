# Marsh Hansen
Through one circumstance or another, the players meet Marsh on the streets of Loftran. Marsh observes that the players are less affected by the sigil than the rest of the people. Marsh himself is also immune to the sigil's effects. He's looking for his parents.

Marsh tells the party his story and asks them for help.

## Marsh's Story
Marsh's parents vanished during one of the early sigil activations a little under a week ago. Marsh survived by hiding in his house and being generally hard to notice. He waited for a couple days, and his parents finally came home. But they were...different. They're eyes looked weird (snake eyes). Life seemed sort of normal other than that for a day, until his parents wanted to take him out at night to meet their "new friends." Marsh went along with it, very creeped out, until he saw the cultists in black robes waiting for him and his parents. They were....wrong (snake heads and snake tails). Marsh screamed and ran, and he hasn't stopped running since. He was making plans to leave the city, when he saw the players and how they were (mostly) immune to the poison of the sigil. He begs the players. He's certain that if he can get his parents back and get them out of the city in time, the poison will wear off and they'll return to normal.

## Objective
Find and rescue Marsh's parents and help him get them out of the city.
