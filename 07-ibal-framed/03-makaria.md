# Makaria
-- BOOKMARK --
The party comes here after finding an invitation to Makaria's parties at the scene of the crime.

## Cross Examination
Having met Makaria before, the party knows that her supply issues have caused her to not have had any parties in weeks. She expresses that she enjoyed the business competition, but isn't really able to offer any proof of her innocence.

## Clues
If the party mentions where Archebald was murdered (if they don't, Makaria will inquire), then Makaria will muse over the strangeness that, if Archebald were indeed on his way to one of her parties, why did he walk? He would have taken a carriage. This should clue the party in and send them to figure out who the Elmwall carriage driver is. Makaria will mention that the she knows the Elmwall carriage driver. Her name is Riswynn. She is a dwarf who lives in a cottage on the outer corner of the Elmwall estate.

The biggest and only real clue to Makaria's innocence will be the party's knowledge that she had a real Mimic Ivy infestation, which caused her supply issues, and prevented her from having a party on the night of the murder.
