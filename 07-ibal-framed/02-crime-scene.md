# Crime Scene
If the players choose to investigate the crime scene, they'll find precious little evidence there. If they return there immediately after escaping from prison, it will have been 5 days since Ibal's arrest. The alley will probably not have been cleaned, but it will have been picked apart by scavengers. A decent Investigation check will reveal the murder weapon, the broken-off bottom half of a nobleman's cane. No distinct markings on it, but far higher quality than anything your run-of-the-mill hitman could obtain. It will eventually match a broken cane at the Elmwall Estate. The party should also find the party invitation to a party at Makaria's manor.
