# Elmwall Estate
The Elmwall Estate is similar to the Makaria estate: a massive property with a massive mansion and a prominent vineyard in back.

Unfortunately, most of the staff has heard Ibal's description, but believe him to be dead, assuming the party hasn't encountered Isaac and Bartel previously. Eerily, the staff will be relatively apathetic to the party's presence. This is due to Viserion's influence.

## Entrances
The estate has a large front door, a back door leading in from the vineyards, and several first-floor windows. None of them are guarded or manned.

## Staff Encounters
Once inside, the party can encounter a number of staff members, all in a daze.

The head butler is a human named Stephan. He can be found slumped in the main dining room. He appears to be sleeping. If disturbed, he'll greet the party, offer to get them tea, then seem to forget their existence unless prompted again.

There will be three maids scattered around the mansion, two gnomes and a half-elf. They'll appear to be cleaning the same small area over and over again. They won't react to the party's presence.

A dog will run past the party. It'll have a large slab of meat in its mouth. It's on its way from the kitchen to it's "den" in one of the guest bedrooms. It's got free reign of the entire house.

## Family Encounters
Bartel is locked in the study. He won't let anyone in. If the party breaks in, he's feverishly packing paperwork, ledgers, and other documents. He's been driven to the brink of sanity by Viserion. If pressed, he'll basically admit to murdering his father, but he'll keep saying "she made me do it, she made me do it" referring to his mother. If he's questioned about where his mother is, he'll mutter "deep damp dark down", which will summon several rodent monsters from the walls. He'll then attack the party. After the fight, if the party examines Bartel's body, they'll find green discoloration under his fingernails and around his eyelids. These are signs of poisoning of some sort.

Isaac's body can be found in the master bedroom. He hung himself with a bedsheet from the chandelier. Examining the body will find similar and more severe symptoms to what Bartel was suffering from (green discoloration around the fingers and eyelids). Around the floor under Isaac's body are five wine bottles with the Elmwall seal on them. Three of them are empty.

Isabella herself is chained up in the wine cellar. She's been down there for about a month when the transformation ritual started, kept alive by Viserion as a source of information and a plaything. She's missing both of her eyes. She'll have no idea that Archebald is dead or what the state of things upstairs is. She'll be in no state to offer more information than that right away. If the party takes pity on her, they can nurse her back to relative health over a long rest.

### Fight Encounter - Bartel
Bartel's mutterings will gradually turn to screeches. The suit of armor on the wall will come to life, and various vermin will emerge from the walls. Bartel himself will transform, taking on a grotesque appearance, not unlike the Yuan-Ti transformations the party has seen before, but much more unstable. Bartel will bleed from open wounds, and his eyes will be different sizes. Bartel uses the stats from a Babau. His blood will congeal into a creature that uses the Black Pudding stat block.

## Secret Garden
The party can find the secret door without too much issue. It'll be the only door on the first floor other than the door to the wine cellar that goes down. After a short trek down a dirt tunnel, they'll come to an open space with a carefully tended garden. There will be dimming hatching stones embedded in the ceiling. Investigating the stones will reveal that they have been processed to emit sunlight, probably to aid in the growth of the plants. The garden has a few small flowers and herbs still growing in varying dazzling colors that none of the party recognizes. There's even a couple that appear to be shimmering, almost as if they're changing colors right before the party's eyes. There is a large divet in the center of the garden where something has been dug out or harvested. Along the wall is a shelf with jugs full of liquid chemicals and bags full of solid ones. Clearly, there was some advanced alchemy going on down here. The party can gain more information about the experiments with a high Survival, Medicine, or Arcana check, or by getting the chemicals and remaining plants in front of someone at the Wizard's College or Tabitha.

## The Garden
Through the channels available to the party, they can learn that the garden was tapping in to an incredible wellspring of magical energy. The soil is practically bleeding it. The flowers and herbs within the garden are charged with it and have very unique properties. No one will be able to tell what was grown in the middle, but it will have immense magical power. It's a Spiritwell Flower. It could be used to fuel spells on the same scale as the transformation ritual, but it would be complete in a matter of hours instead of weeks. It could be used to open portals to other worlds. It might even be able to wake the giants.

This will probably be the first time the party has heard of the giants that built the world. Loftran is built on the heart of one of those giants. Their remains are all over the world. Many who believe in the truth of this myth also believe that the giants are long dead, but some believe that a few survived and are merely sleeping.

Viserion's end goal is yet to be determined, but she's not in the city anymore. The nearest other civilizations are Hazelton and Bramhold, to the south.

## Isabella's Interrogation
-- BOOKMARK --
Isabella won't know how long she's been locked in the basement, but she'll have no knowledge of her husband's death or the transformation ritual around the city. She won't recognize Ibal or any of the other party members. She'll be distraught over Isaac and Archebald's deaths, and Bartel's, if the party killed him.

She'll recount the events leading up to her imprisonment if asked.

Archebald invited in a new friend one day. He introduced this person as Visera. She was an elven woman of noble bearing, with piercing green eyes. Isabella welcomed this new guest into their home. The three of them talked about this and that, mostly about how business was in Loftran. Visera was looking to purchase some land and wanted some advice. Archebald couldn't resist talking about how fertile the land was and how proud he was of his family for keeping this slice of especially fertile land. Isabella noticed Visera's interest perk up at the mention of the Elmwall land's qualities, but paid it no attention. All was well for a while after that, but Archebald kept finding more excuses to invite Visera over, but Isabella never heard of her actually purchasing an estate in Loftran. She was just... around. She was around so much that Isaac and Bartel started referring to her as "Aunt V." Visera was always paying compliments to how fertile the land was. After they had been "friends" for several weeks, Isabella noticed a new door had been built on the first floor. The door was always locked and Archebald forbade her from attempting to open it or finding out what was down there.

One night, Isabella was awoken up by thumping in the house. She followed it into one of the guest bedrooms and found Visera standing over Archebald. He was dazed, but with a large smile on his face. She was.... monstrous. As Isabella watched, Visera's skin turned black. Isabella cried out and dropped her candle and the... thing whirled on her. It lunged at her. The next thing she knew, Isabella woke up chained to the stone in the wine cellar. The Visera... thing, came to visit her, to thank her for inviting it into their home. Then it transformed into Isabella and laughed its way back upstairs. It would come down from time to time, to bring bits of food, and to take things from Isabella. First it was her hair, then it was her blood, finally it was her eyes.
