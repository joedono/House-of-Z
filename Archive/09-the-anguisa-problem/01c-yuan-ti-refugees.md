# Yuan-Ti Refugees
At some point during the construction of the ship, one of the party will be approached by a pair of hooded figures. This is Zerdan and Daniel Mitsk, two brothers who are attempting to covertly leave the city. They were transformed into Yuan-Ti Purebloods during the ritual of Zehir, but they are lucid and want nothing to do with the god of poison. They don't feel that they can stay in the city due to the intense and sometimes murderous discrimination they'd face. The party has seen the increased night patrols first-hand.

They'll want to enlist the party's help in leaving the city on their ship and going north. The only problem is that they don't want to leave their elderly mother behind, but she can't really move on her own. Cazra Mitsk is still fully human, but completely senile. She hasn't noticed that her sons are part snake, or anything else that happened in the city recently. They offer 50gp as payment.

They're basically trapped in their house in the SE corner of Heartswall (right next to where one of the sigils was). If questioned about why they do not simply sneak out, Daniel will cite the increased night patrols and the fact that they used to have a sister.

## Options
The party has a couple of options here for getting the Mitsks out of the city.

Zerdan will want to get as far away from the city as possible, but Cazra can't really walk on her own. Ideally, they'd like to charter a ship. It moves under its own power, has lots of hiding places, and Cazra won't be able to wander around too much. So the party can hide the Mitsks in Eloreth Mansion until it's time to leave aboard the Sea Spear. Then the Mitsks can either stow away on the ship, or be taken on as legitimate passengers. Krusk won't really care about Cazra so long as her fee is paid, but he won't want to take on snake people.

Another option, if the party remembers (have them make an Int check if not), is that Horsemaster Brom still owes them a favor for rescuing at least some of his horses during the first nights of the Zehir Ritual. He'll be a little hesitant, but easily convinced to secret the Mitsks out of the city in a carriage.

Another option could be that the party takes the Mitsks to the House of Sunlight to see if they can be cured. It worked for the Hansens. Sister Thia and Brother Kellen will be happy to do so. The party will still have to bring the Mitsks to the House of Sunlight. Thia and Kellen have set up a reverse transmutation circle that they have perfected after numerous other Yuan-Ti partial transformations have made their way into the church.

Of course, they could just sneak the Mitsks out of the city and leave them to their own devices, but Cazra's condition doesn't make that likely. Zerdan and Daniel won't take too kindly to that.

## Sneaking
Getting the Mitsks anywhere will take some stealth, as there are now nightly patrols for shadows and Yuan-Ti (among other threats). The party can try to get them out during the day, but the regular folk are just as paranoid as the night watches. Getting them through the city will be a skill challenge, disguising the Mitsks to hide their faces, sneaking around patrols, creating distractions, and not getting lost in the chaos.

### Obstacles - Night
* Patrolling Guards
* Homeless layabouts looking to cash in on the rewards for turning in Yuan-Ti
* Drunks
* Thieves
* Stray Animals
* Evil Yuan-Ti refugees looking for allies

### Obstacles - Day
* Crowds
* Patrolling Guards (less alert than at night)
* Homeless layabouts
* Thieves
* Stray Animals

## Escape
If the Mitsks stow away on the ship, they'll stick with the party until they hear about the other Yuan-Ti that Krusk took to the Heavenly Cay that then journeyed south to the Gippli Village south of the Heavenly Cay (where the party will end up as part of the Book of Cylinders).

If the Mitsks get a carriage and a horse from Brom, then they'll head south and almost certainly never be heard from again.
