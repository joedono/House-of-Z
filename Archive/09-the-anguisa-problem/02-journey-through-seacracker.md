# Journey Through Seacracker
The party has chartered passage to the Heavenly Cay aboard the Sea Spear, captained by a half-orc named Krusk. The journey will take about a week. The party will be expected to contribute to the maintenance and protection of the ship.

## Sea Spear
https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/UA_ShipsSea.pdf

The Sea Spear is a Galley Ship. A Gargantuan ship with 4 Ballistas, 2 Mangonels, and a Ram.

Movement around the islands is difficult, but doable. There are certain routes that the ship cannot take due to its size, but Krusk is confident that the remaining routes are safe enough to travel.

## The Crew
Krusk - The captain. Half-orc male. Very serious, but takes good care of his crew above all else. Tolerates fighting, but only "officiated" duels to settle disputes or friendly competitions. Understands the waters, crew dynamics, weather, and management better than most.

Brocc - First mate. Half-orc male. Reads Krusk very well and knows where his limits are. The perfect foil to Krusk's seriousness. Brings some much needed levity to the crew, but sometimes has to be reined in by Krusk when things get too rowdy.

Harim - Second mate and helmsman. medium human male. Usually at the helm unless Krusk takes the wheel. Quiet and stoic, rarely talks. Likes to whittle, but has a habit of taking pieces of the ship for his projects.

Lily - Lookout and navigator. Small female human. Can "smell" storms. Keeps a sketchbook full of pictures of creatures of the sea, but no one's quite sure which are real and which are fantasies. Will show the book to anyone who shows the slightest interest.

Candice - Cook. Large female human. Actually hates seafood, so she keeps a library of spices to make fish taste like other things. Gets a lot of complaints from the crew such as "just feed me a bleedin trout, woman!" The crew is always joking with comments like this, but Candice responds seriously, usually by threatening to clock them with her pots.

Folmon - Bosun/Engineer. Medium male elf. Has a persistent layer of sawdust or soot all over him. Has a tendency to talk to the ship, nicknaming it Sally. Usually, it's endearing, but most of the time, it's creepy.

Respen - Surgeon. Skinny male elf. Cleanest one on the crew. Likes to read. Doesn't brag about it, but he's the best shot with the ballista that Krusk has ever known.

## The Journey
Before leaving, Captain Krusk will ask the party how they expect to be useful on the ship during times of peace and during times of war.

During times of peace, players can:
* Clean the ship
* If proficient in Perception, serve as lookout
* If proficient in Performance, provide entertainment to the crew through music or storytelling
* If proficient in Athletics or Acrobatics, provide entertainment to the crew through physical feats
* If proficient in History or Religion, provide entertainment to the crew through storytelling
* If proficient in Investigation, inspect the ship for damages
* If you have a +4 bonus in Medicine or higher, help with cooking
* If proficient in Medicine, help the surgeon
* Virtually any other task the players can come up with

During times of war, Krusk will ask:
* Which of the party is suited for close-range anti-infantry combat, suitable to repel boarders (Fran, Ibal)
* Which of the party is suited for long-range anti-infantry combat, such as archery, suitable for attacking crew on other ships (Theryn, Ardin)
* Which of the party is suited for anti-ship combat, such as large scale spellcasting, suitable for attacking enemy ships (Valmar)
* Which of the party is suitable for healing and support (Liara)

Hazards along the route include whirlpools, pirates, sahuagin, killer whales, griffins, and harpies, but fortunately no LARGE swimming creatures such as krakens or dragon turtles. Many large flying creatures make nests on the islands.

### Encounters
Roll 1d12 per day at sea. The journey will take 10 days.

* 1-3 - Clear Skies
* 4-5 - Light Drizzle
* 6 - Storm
* 7 - Whirlpool - DONE
* 8 - Berserker Raiding Party - DONE
* 9 - Harpy Attack - DONE
* 10 - Adult Bronze Dragon - DONE
* 11 - Floating Debris
* 12 - Ghost Ship

#### 1-3 Clear Skies and Peaceful Waters
Nothing happens. Smooth sailing

#### 4-5 Light Drizzle
Light rain, slight wind, but very manageable. Perhaps a portent of what's to come?

#### 6 Storm
Heavy storm with harsh wind and large waves.

Skill Challenge. Things to do:
* Secure doors and shutters with battens - Dexterity check
* Secure luggage, ammo, and other things in the hold - Dexterity check
* Raise the main sail and drop the storm sail - Athletics check
* Water is starting to accumulate in the hold. It needs to be bailed - Athletics check

Complications:
* A large wave knocks Harim off of the helm. Someone needs to take the helm or else the ship will run aground - Wisdom check
* Lightning has struck the main mast, damaging the ropes holding the main sail in place. The sail unfurls and starts catching wind, making steering almost impossible and threatening to capsize the ship.
* Several lines have come loose above deck, allowing debris and other hard things to roll around hazardously - Acrobatics check

#### 7 Whirlpool
A tiny eddy has evolved into a great maelstrom that threatens to suck the ship under.

Skill Challenge. All the same hazards as Storm

#### 8 Berserker Raiding Party
The lookouts spot that the strait the ship is sailing down has been blocked by a rockslide. The captain gives orders to bring the ship around. As the ship is turning, great cranks on either side of the other end of the strait pull a great chain out of the water, blocking the other exit. Now boxed in, rowboats carrying Berserkers leave the shore and attempt to board the ship.

The party can attempt to fight off all the berserkers, but the primary objective should be to destroy the chain blocking the ship in.

#### 9 Harpy Attack
One of the islands the ship passes turns out to be the current nesting ground for a flock of harpies. The smell of fresh meat brings the harpies out of hiding and they harass the ship.

#### 10 Friendly and Curious Adult Bronze Dragon
The lookouts will notify the captain that the kelp and seaweed around the ship has turned blue, yellow, and purple. Krusk knows that this means they have entered the region where a Bronze Dragon has made its nest. He advises the party to be cautious, but friendly.

Bronze Dragons adore stories and treasure, but never steal from the living or kill for loot. Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the shipâ€™s captain for the item.

Krusk has captained the Sea Spear through the islands for nearly a decade, and is well familiar with this sort of encounter. He's ready with trinkets to trade and points the dragon at the party, saying that they must have daring stories of heroism to tell.

This dragon's name is Frammel, The Stubborn. Her father knew and fought Anguisa the Anguisher, and was part of the party who helped seal her. Her father fell to Viserion soon after though. She won't recognize anything special about Valmar/Liara right away, and won't believe that the vessel was broken, because her "father wouldn't make anything so easily broken." She'll also confirm, through her own abilities, that dragons can shapeshift into other creatures very easily.

#### 11 Floating Debris
The lookouts will notify the captain that there is debris in the water, likely from a previous shipwreck. The captain will call to drop anchor and send divers to investigate the wreckage to see if there's anything worth salvaging.

The party can join if they wish, and they can keep anything they find that's not directly beneficial to ship maintenance or crew sustainment. I.e., gold goes to the crew, magic items go to the party. Along the way, the party will notice a giant bones under the water. These will be the inert rib bones of Draffnir, and they might be too large for the players to understand what they are, like how a giant footprint will just seem like a lake.

#### 12 Ghost Ship
Stat Block https://i.redd.it/08h19wuql0o01.jpg

A ghost ship emerges from the depths and rams into the Sea Spear, allowing dozens of undead creatures to swarm her decks. Krusk is a seasoned captain, but he's never seen this before. He calls for battle stations and a fight ensues.

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/skeleton
https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bone-naga
https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/deathlock

The ghost ship is captained by a Deathlock and his two pet Bone Nagas. They and their crew of skeletons harass ships passing through the islands.

## Bluerim Village
Make sure a hard-ish battle happens near the midway point. The captain will want to stop at Bluerim Village, a halfway waystation village located on a large-ish island almost exactly in the middle of the Seacracker archipelago. The price to dock here is a barrel full of food or other supplies, which the captain will be prepared to pay. After that, the party has free run of the village for the night. There's a general store, a blacksmith, several farms, fishers, and the Black Rose inn. Settle in for **Beneath the Black Rose** horror module.
