# Summary
Now that the party has obtained the Large Hatching Stone and the freshly brewed Panacea potion, they have to locate the ritual site. With the clues from Kellen's account, they should conclude that the ritual location is under Loftran Castle, and that the palace guards and likely the king have been converted (he hasn't. He's missing). They'll have to find a way into the bowels of the castle.

## Options for Infiltration
They could go in the front gate. They'll probably be blocked and arrested immediately, all their equipment confiscated, and sent to Hanging Noose prison again.

If the party has encountered Marsh, and maybe helped him with finding his parents, he'll be able to help. Considering that he's been hiding from most people for the past few days, he will suggest the sewer route, which will lead the party to the castle basement relatively unhindered.

The party could also come up with their own method for infiltration, depending on who they've encountered by this point. Tabitha sells potions of transformation that could be used for general infiltration. Makaria and Aiden both have some strings they can pull that will get the party an invitation into the party that is happening that night. The Hatching Stone miners could provide them with explosives or tunneling equipment to get into the basement.
