# Mimic Ivy Fight
The party has located Mimic Ivy, either in Makaria's vineyards or in the Whittletwig's farm. Each location has different hazards. The Mimic Ivy reveals itself by blooming several large green flowers. The flowers can be attacked, but they can retract and bloom anywhere on infected vines.

## Locating the Ivy
The fruits were only infected by the Mimic Ivy one month ago, which is just long enough for the residents to start becoming suspicious about the supply issue. They're probably a day or two away from hiring official help. The onsite help has been preoccupied trying to find issues with the soil or insects spoiling the fruit. It won't have occurred to anyone that Mimic Ivy would be the problem. It's pretty rare, after all. In this case, almost 3/4 of the fruits are actually Mimic Ivy bulbs.

The party will learn that someone has disappeared recently in among the fruit. Perhaps a farm-boy or the estate dog.

Attacking or otherwise interacting with most of the under-ripe fruit will yield similar results to interacting with normal under-ripe fruit. After some investigating, the party will find a couple of fruits that are slightly bigger than the rest and are pulsing slightly, almost as if they're breathing. These are the "core" of the ivy. Attacking these will cause the fruit to be sucked back into the vine, and a small lump will travel along the vine to another location. Doing this three times will trigger combat, as the "core" bulbs bloom into large flowers, grow two thrashing vine-tentacles, and attempt to ensnare anything nearby.

If the party elects to attack the "normal" Mimic Ivy fruit, then the larger "core" bulbs will come to their defense after 20 damage has been done.

## Complications

### Vineyard
Due to mimicking ferment-able fruits, the Mimic Ivy in the vineyard has the ability to emit a cloud of alcoholic gas. See *Fermented Gas* below.

### Farm
The farm is littered with crude traps set by the farmers. The players will already know that these are threats, but probably haven't discovered all of them. Traps such as:

* Trip Ropes - Moving through this space prompts a DC 15 Dex save or the character falls prone.
* Caltrops - Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.
* Rigged beehives - DC 15 Dex save, or the trigger smacks the beehive, angering the bees and causing them to swarm, creating a cloud covering an area in a 10ft radius around the hive. Any creature that enters or ends its turn in the area must make a DC 12 CON save or take 1d6 piercing damage from the bee stingers. Setting the hive on fire will disperse the bees.
* Piles of manure - Areas covered in manure are considered difficult terrain. Entering or passing through the area covers characters in manure. Until cleaned, the character has disadvantage on stealth and concentration checks.

## Rewards
If the party harvests the Mimic Ivy at the Whittletwig farm, they find that it had generated a couple magical gems, kind of like how a clam generates pearls.

If they harvest the Mimic Ivy at the Makaria Vineyard, then Makaria will send a courier with some rewards for them at a later time. See chapter 5-1 Makaria Reward.

Mimic Ivy manifests as three (maybe four) blooming flowers on the map. The flowers all share the ivy's base hit point pool and are the only points vulnerable to damage. Any attack made by the Mimic Ivy comes from a bloomed flower. Each flower takes its own turn, but only one flower can use Multiattack per round.

### Lair Actions

#### Plant Movement
One flower retracts and another one blooms elsewhere on the map.

#### Fermented Gas (Vineyard Variant)
Emit a sweet-smelling gas that covers a 10ft cube around each of the flowers. Gas lasts 1d6 turns or until a strong wind blows it away. Creatures that enter the affected area or end their turn inside must make a DC 15 CON save or become drunk. They remain drunk while in the affected area. Leaving the area ends the effect on the creature. Engulfed creatures are unaffected.

##### Drunk Condition
A drunk character has disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, but believes they have advantage.

### Actions

#### Multiattack
The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 14), and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.

#### Slam
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

#### Engulf
The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
