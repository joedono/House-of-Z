# Summary
The party has finished their trek across the Seacracker Islands and arrived at The Heavenly Cay. They are in search of Professor Adran Galonodel, the elven professor of humanoid biology at the Ivory Tower, the foremost magical academy in the world. The party arrives partway through the Stoneheart festival, celebrating the summer solstice.

The party locates Adran, but he is unable to perform the extraction on the soul of Anguisa. He has run out of his specially treated giant crab blood. The party must find out why the supply from the grippli village to the south has stopped coming, kicking off the Book of Cylinders. The reason the Yuan-Ti are harassing the Grippli and forcing them to excavate beneath their temple is because the Giant Finger Bones are located down there, and Viserion needs their essence in order to construct a new Giant for use in the Great War.

Adran is accompanied by his newest apprentice, a halfling named Rion Blackspice, actually Viserion in disguise. Rion has a pet lizard familiar named Fangs, actually King Samuel of Loftran under the effect of a True Polymorph spell. Rion is also in possession of Liara's clan's magic tome (with the symbol of Thorm, her diety, on it), which has a collection of spells in it, including True Polymorph and True Resurrection, which Rion is attempting to cast in order to resurrect Anguisa, once he locates her soul.

Rion will attempt to steal the sealed soul of Anguisa once the extraction is complete, and take her to a secure location where he can perform the True Resurrection ritual.
