# War of Monsters
When the party eventually decides to venture east of Southspark to see what the war is all about, here's what they will find.

## Base Camp
The military base camp, just short of the "front-lines" is HUGE. Much too big to be for anything that would escape the notice of the rest of the world. The camp is big enough to have it's own economy and marketplace. There are soldiers everywhere, doing drills, sleeping, eating, training, etc. Unless otherwise notes, everyone is illusory.

## Stables
The stables here are full of a variety of animals. There are many horses, but there are also camels, donkeys, boars, hippogriffs, and even a pegasus. There is a small platoon of stable-hands, but they only burst into activity when there is a deep invasion planned, and there isn't one for another couple of days.

## Mess Hall
There are two long huts that serve as mess halls for the soldiers. They are owned and operated by the brothers Marley, Farley, and George, the same brothers who work in the miners' guild in Southspark proper.

## Infirmary
Run by Doctor Ivans, a dwarvish surgeon. The infirmary is completely empty, since the only ones who return from battle are completely uninjured. Doctor Ivans is NOT illusory, and isn't really sure what he's doing here. He's only treated one person in the past year, and their only problem was malnutrition. From eating nothing but illusory foods, of course.

## Armory
A well-oiled machine that is nearly constantly dropping out shields, breastplates, and swords through an opening in the side. No one actually works here. It's just machinery. There's a large drop-chute on the other side that receives metal ores which it turns into equipment.

## Barracks
There are three barracks spread around the camp.

## General's Tent
The biggest tent belongs to the general of the war effort, Brutus Maxwell, a male human fighter. When the party arrives, Brutus will be arguing with his lieutenants over a map of the foothills, saying that they're losing too much ground and wondering if he should find someone else to lead the 3rd and 4th platoons or something. When he stops for breath, he'll notice the party and demand to know who they are.

Brutus will mention that the key to winning this war is to remove whatever is behind the enemy lines that keeps replenishing their numbers. The mortal forces have the monsters surrounded and cut off, but there never seems to be any shortage of reinforcements over there. Actually, the Skull just keeps creating new monsters.

## Illusory Clues
If the party splits up or attempts to observe something on their own, they're likely to see a clue reminiscent of a buggy video game.

* Two squadrons of completely identical soldiers doing identical drills
* Soldiers running around a corner and disappearing
* Tents with identical wear and tear
* A cat that seems to teleport
* Soldiers singing songs on repeat

## 4th Platoon
If the party shows any interest in the war, Brutus will immediately assign them to Plentus Ardbare, lieutenant of the 4th platoon, and one that is in dire need of reinforcements. If the party goes along with this, they'll be swept up into a skirmish in the northern hills.

If Halfrek's group is still with the party, Brutus will assign them to the 9th Platoon. They'll head southeast and disappear as soon as they are out of range of the players.

The 4th Platoon is made up of 20 humans, 2 elves, 2 orcs, and 6 goblins. The goblins are defectors who joined the humanoid army because they have better food. The platoon is scheduled to make a push for the northern hills the next afternoon.

## Surprise Attack!
If the party is made part of the 4th Platoon in the morning, they are sent out that afternoon and encounter this fight. If they are made part of the platoon in the evening, they are encouraged to rest and be ready to move out the following day. If they spend the night, there will be a surprise attack in the middle of the night.

The attack consists of 10 ogres and 2 night hags

The party will be aided by Veterans, along with Halfrek, Raya, Juno, and Seebo

The skirmish will resolve without too many issues, with one of the hags fleeing into the night. If the party gives chase, she'll disappear when she rounds a foothill. If any of the soldiers were killed, they'll be buried without fuss. If any were injured, they'll be better by morning without treatment.

The big clue given to the party during this fight will be the monsters' battle cry "For the Skull!!"

## Next Steps
Hopefully, the party has figured out that their next step is to secure the Skull, which is underground beneath the heart of the monster's territory.
