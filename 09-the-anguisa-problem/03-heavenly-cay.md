# Heavenly Cay
Ibal's home, which means his family is in the vicinity.

A very high-brow city of most elves. A lot of value is placed on the study of the world through magic. Travel between the islands is aided by magical bridges that act as moving walkways, similar to a modern airport. But those only extend around the locations immediately adjacent to the city. The city residents all take basic sailing lessons as a matter of course, although it's rare for a citizen to take sailor as an actual profession. They're necessary and not really looked down upon, but it's seen as a bit of a dead-end job since it doesn't offer a path to enlightenment.

## Ivory Tower
The premiere magical academy in this world. The Wizard's College in Loftran is second, but both will tell you they are the best. While the Wizard's College is an advocate for "everyone deserves knowledge", The Ivory Tower is much snobbier about who they teach, requiring that you demonstrate significant potential in magical studies in order to be granted privileges and access and stuff. The Heavenly Cay is a geniocracy, rule by the intelligent. This means that the headmaster of the Ivory Tower and his advisers also serve as the ruling body for the Heavenly Cay as a whole.

The whole neighborhood is going to be very similar to Hogwarts and the various magical areas presented in the books.

## Viserion and King Samuel
Viserion has brought King Samuel here because he needs the special equipment in the Ivory Tower biological research division in order to extract Samuel's "giant's blood". Just extracting his blood will result in just regular blood. The giant's blood will move around the body, avoiding contact with any injuries or other openings. An injection of treated giant crab blood needs to be administered to identify the blood, then special equipment needs to be employed to freeze the giant's blood in place, then detect it where it's frozen, and then to draw it out. The process leaves the victim a shell of their former selves.

So, Viserion is masquerading as a medical student at the Ivory Tower, working on a plan to gain access to the advanced medical equipment necessary to perform the procedure. The king is under the effect of a True Polymorph spell, and is now in the form of a lizard. Viserion stole a spell scroll from a traveling wizard. Viserion has assumed the guise of a clumsy halfling named Rion Blackspice, with his pet lizard Fangs. Viserion is also attempting to research the location of the Giant Finger Bones said to be somewhere in the archipelago. The party may meet him while they're in the city.

Depending on where the players look, they may discover that Rion is in possession of Liara's clan's advanced spellbook. The book contains a selection of 9th level spells, including True Resurrection, which Viserion needs in order to bring Anguisa back to life.

## Professor Adran Galanodel
The person the party is looking for is the head of humanoid biology and research at The Heavenly Cay, Professor Adran Galanodel.

TODO

Adran will examine Liara/Valmar/Anguisa and say that he thinks that his "treated blood extraction process" can be adapted to home in on the soul and draw it out. Unfortunately, his supply of giant crab blood has run out, and they've stopped receiving their usual supply from the Grippli village to the south, along with Adran's favorite crab meat dish. If the party can travel south and find out why the Grippli have stopped sending crab blood and meat to The Heavenly Cay, he'll be happy to help them. He'll have heard of a band of Yuan-Ti that sailed that way some weeks ago, around the time that the supplies stopped.

And thus starts the Book of Cylinders
