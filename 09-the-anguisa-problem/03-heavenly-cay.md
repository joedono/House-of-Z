# Heavenly Cay
The party arrives at The Heavenly Cay after a grueling trek across the Seacracker Isles. Krusk and Brocc park the ship at the south-western port, the main port for all trade vessels. They'll be in port for a while, unloading their shipment of trade goods and waiting for their next client, a shipment of high quality textiles bound for Linen Street back in Loftran. They'll happily offer the party a return trip for 20gp/person again, but they're not leaving for another month. Brocc will suggest that the party enjoy the festival.

The day when the party arrives is the third day of a 5-day long summer solstice festival called Stoneheart. There are 3 other such holidays that celebrate the fall equinox, winter solstice, and spring equinox, called Festival of Ravens, Oxstone, and The Festival of Flowers respectively.

Stoneheart is characterized by parades, food stands, and the exchange of gifts, traditionally those created within the past year. It is a festival of growth and taking advantage of the fruits of our labor. The city will be very noisy and friendly during this time.

## Professor Adran Galanodel
The person the party is looking for is the head of humanoid biology and research at The Ivory Tower, Professor Adran Galanodel.

When the party arrives, Adran is in an ox-drawn carriage with a humanoid skeleton puppet that is fully articulate mounted on top walking in the parade. Soon after the party finds him, the float behind Adran's explodes prematurely, spooking the ox and setting the carriage on fire, and causing them to run rampant through the streets. A chase ensues.

### The Chase
Skill Challenge
DC = 16
Challenges = 7
Goal: Stop the runaway ox-drawn carriage with minimal collateral damage and with minimal damage to Adran's person

1. The carriage dashes past an aquatic float, with an aquarium. Maybe there's a way to use the water to put out the fire.
2. A party member could get onto the carriage and try to calm the oxen
3. The carriage dashes past a botanical float, full of cabbages. Maybe there's a way to destroy it, spilling the cabbages into the street in front of the oxen, calming them
4. The carriage is speeding towards a group of children. Move the children or redirect the oxen
5. Rion Blackspice attempts to cast a spell to solve the situation, but the party recognizes the sigils for the Fly spell. Stop the him before he makes things worse.
6. The carriage makes a sharp turn down a street that is under construction. There are mounds of dirt everywhere. Maybe the dirt could be used to slow the oxen or put out the fire. Or maybe the oxen will cause greater havoc and damage to the carriage
7. A dog is running alongside the carriage, barking and further spooking the oxen. Get her out of there before she gets trampled.

### Examination
Adran will examine Liara/Valmar/Anguisa. He'll have similar findings to Baern from the Wizard's College, but he'll be more fully confident in his "extract & contain" procedure. His "treated blood extraction process" can be adapted to home in on the soul and draw it out, since it works on all "essences" within a body. Unfortunately, the process requires specially treated giant crab blood in order to mark the desired essence for extraction. Adran will mention that the same procedure was used in a bygone era to extract the Blood of the Giants from those descended from the giants who created the world. The party might remember that "Blood of the Giants" is on that list they found in Loftran.

The Ivory Tower's supply of giant crab blood has run out, and they've stopped receiving their usual shipments from the Grippli village to the south, along with Adran's favorite crab meat dish. If the party can travel south and find out why the Grippli have stopped sending crab blood and meat to The Heavenly Cay, he'll be happy to help them. He'll have heard of a band of Yuan-Ti that sailed that way some weeks ago, around the time that the supplies stopped.

And thus starts the **Book of Cylinders**

## Viserion and King Samuel
Viserion has brought King Samuel here because he needs the special equipment in the Ivory Tower biological research division in order to extract Samuel's "Blood of the Giants". Just extracting his blood normally will result in just regular blood. The giant's blood will move around the body, avoiding contact with any injuries or other openings. An injection of treated giant crab blood needs to be administered to identify the blood, then special equipment needs to be employed to freeze the giant's blood in place, then detect it where it's frozen, and then to draw it out. The process leaves the victim a shell of their former selves.

So, Viserion is masquerading as a medical student at the Ivory Tower and assistant to Adran Galanodel, working on a plan to gain access to the advanced medical equipment necessary to perform the procedure. The king is under the effect of a True Polymorph spell, and is now in the form of a lizard. Viserion stole a spell scroll from a traveling wizard. Viserion has assumed the guise of a clumsy halfling named Rion Blackspice, with his pet lizard Fangs. Viserion is also attempting to research the location of the Giant Finger Bones said to be somewhere in the archipelago. The party may meet him while they're in the city.

Depending on where the players look, they may discover that Rion is in possession of Liara's clan's advanced spellbook. The book contains a selection of 9th level spells, including True Resurrection, which Viserion needs in order to bring Anguisa back to life, and the True Polymorph spell that transformed King Samuel into the lizard, Fangs.

## Deathbringers
The Deathbringer HQ is located in The Gilded Circle. The tiefling named Hope will make herself known soon after the party inquires about her. The headquarters isn't really a secret, but it presents itself as a mercenary industry rather than an order devoted to destroying undead. There's a good chance someone here will have heard about Anguisa's release and have a hunting party out looking for clues.
