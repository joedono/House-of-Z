# The Anguisa Problem
The party is on a minor quest to extract the soul of Anguisa from Valmar/Liara, lest it cause them further problems. They received a tip from Baern, the professor of humanoid biological research at the Wizard's College in Loftran, that they might have the appropriate knowledge and equipment at the Ivory Tower, the other premiere wizard's college on this continent, located within The Heavenly Cay, an elvish city in the Seacracker Islands to the North-West.

## Seacracker Islands
A network of islands arranged in strange patterns with treacherous currents and dangerous obstacles. Sailing through here without a current map or an experienced sailor is a recipe for death. Loftran, Durrstahft, and the Cay both have master sailors for hire and maps for sale depending on what the players want, but navigating through the waters is still perilous. Many dangerous creatures live there.

## Frostcracker Islands
The northern reaches of the islands are even more dangerous than Seacracker, due to the presence of ice flows. One is never actually sure whether the island is actually an island or just a really big ice block. Because there's fewer people up here, there's more monsters.
