# Journey Through Seacracker
In order to get to The Heavenly Cay, the party must obtain a boat and a crew, and chart a course through the Seacracker Islands, which are densely packed and fraught with dangers, both from the treacherous currents, shallow reefs, and numerous predators.

Travel through here is going to take about a week in-game and be hella exciting. Roll on the random encounter table under General Information at least once a day. Have the captain and the crew act on their own initiative in combat encounters.

The Sea Spear is a Galley

## Halfway House
Make sure a hard-ish battle happens near the midway point. The captain will want to stop at Bluerim Village, a halfway waystation village located on a large-ish island almost exactly in the middle of the archipelago. The price to dock here is a barrel full of food or other supplies, which the captain will be prepared to pay. After that, the party has free run of the village for the night. There's a general store, a blacksmith, several farms, fishers, and the Black Rose inn. Settle in for Beneath the Black Rose horror module.
