# Journey Through Seacracker
-- BOOKMARK --
The party has chartered passage to the Heavenly Cay aboard the Sea Spear, captained by a half-orc named Krusk. The journey will take about a week. The party will be expected to contribute to the maintenance and protection of the ship.

## Sea Spear
https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/UA_ShipsSea.pdf

The Sea Spear is a Galley Ship. A Gargantuan ship with 4 Ballistas, 2 Mangonels, and a Ram.

Movement around the islands is difficult, but doable. There are certain routes that the ship cannot take due to its size, but Krusk is confident that the remaining routes are safe enough to travel.

Hazards along the route include whirlpools, pirates, sahuagin, killer whales, griffins, and harpies, but fortunately no LARGE swimming creatures such as krakens or dragon turtles. Many large flying creatures make nests on the islands.

#### 8 Berserker Raiding Party
The lookouts spot that the strait the ship is sailing down has been blocked by a rockslide. The captain gives orders to bring the ship around. As the ship is turning, great cranks on either side of the other end of the strait pull a great chain out of the water, blocking the other exit. Now boxed in, rowboats carrying Berserkers leave the shore and attempt to board the ship.

The party can attempt to fight off all the berserkers, but the primary objective should be to destroy the chain blocking the ship in.

#### 9 Harpy Attack
One of the islands the ship passes turns out to be the current nesting ground for a flock of harpies. The smell of fresh meat brings the harpies out of hiding and they harass the ship.

#### 10 Friendly and Curious Adult Bronze Dragon
The lookouts will notify the captain that the kelp and seaweed around the ship has turned blue, yellow, and purple. Krusk knows that this means they have entered the region where a Bronze Dragon has made its nest. He advises the party to be cautious, but friendly.

Bronze Dragons adore stories and treasure, but never steal from the living or kill for loot. Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the shipâ€™s captain for the item.

Krusk has captained the Sea Spear through the islands for nearly a decade, and is well familiar with this sort of encounter. He's ready with trinkets to trade and points the dragon at the party, saying that they must have daring stories of heroism to tell.

This dragon's name is Frammel, The Stubborn. Her father knew and fought Anguisa the Anguisher, and was part of the party who helped seal her. Her father fell to Viserion soon after though. She won't recognize anything special about Valmar/Liara right away, and won't believe that the vessel was broken, because her "father wouldn't make anything so easily broken." She'll also confirm, through her own abilities, that dragons can shapeshift into other creatures very easily.

#### 11 Floating Debris
The lookouts will notify the captain that there is debris in the water, likely from a previous shipwreck. The captain will call to drop anchor and send divers to investigate the wreckage to see if there's anything worth salvaging.

The party can join if they wish, and they can keep anything they find that's not directly beneficial to ship maintenance or crew sustainment. I.e., gold goes to the crew, magic items go to the party.

A ghost ship emerges from the depths and rams into the Sea Spear, allowing dozens of undead creatures to swarm her decks. Krusk is a seasoned captain, but he's never seen this before. He calls for battle stations and a fight ensues.

## Bluerim Village
Make sure a hard-ish battle happens near the midway point. The captain will want to stop at Bluerim Village, a halfway waystation village located on a large-ish island almost exactly in the middle of the Seacracker archipelago. The price to dock here is a barrel full of food or other supplies, which the captain will be prepared to pay. After that, the party has free run of the village for the night. There's a general store, a blacksmith, several farms, fishers, and the Black Rose inn. Settle in for **Beneath the Black Rose** horror module.
