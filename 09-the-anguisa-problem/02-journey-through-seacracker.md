# Journey Through Seacracker
In order to get to The Heavenly Cay, the party must obtain a boat and a crew, and chart a course through the Seacracker Islands, which are densely packed and fraught with dangers, both from the treacherous currents, shallow reefs, and numerous predators.

Travel through here is going to take about a week in-game and be hella exciting.
