# Makaria Resurgence Party
The Makaria Estate is holding a party in just over a week that the players have an invitation to. This is meant to showcase that Makaria is back on the map, as her vineyard has recovered and she is producing wine again.

The party can choose how they'd like to be announced, and Bel'krell will announce them appropriately.

Bart, the groundskeeper will be out front tending to hedges when the party arrives. He'll greet them. If they stop to talk, he'll make a show of how happy he's been lately now that the vineyard is back in business and Baelor isn't pissed all the time (as much). Bart also adopted a new cat that he named Pine after his favorite tree.

Baelor will make some appearances during the party, puffing out his chest at his latest creations: Honey Hellfire, Pursue Sensation, and Cherry Succulent. At some point, he'll overhear a small group of young nobles bad-mouthing the taste of the new wine, calling it "gimmicky", which Baelor will take extreme offense at, possibly instigating a duel.

## Attendees
Other noble attendees the players might encounter.

* Aiden Collander - Human male. Familiar to the players as a fruit and wine merchant. Has a good relationship with Makaria, but is seen as a lower class noble since he manages his own shop. Still VERY well connected.
* Seebo Timbers - Male gnome. Labor manager. Basically an unskilled worker contract manager. Employs about half the Hatching Stone Miners.
* Peren and Enna Nailo - Male and Female half-elf. Own a textile company that's hit on hard times. Their business includes the warehouse on Linen Street. The very same one the party rescued the Hansens from during the Yuan-Ti Transformation Ritual. They're confident their business will turn around soon. They have a good business relationship with Linda Linen. *Peren is an accomplished archer*
* Patricia Barakas - Human female. Childhood friend of Makaria. Her family owns the Maple Leaves Residence.
* Alfred Barakas - Human male. Patricia's husband. Extremely likely to get drunk and raucous during the party.
* Dagnal Fireforge - Dwarven female. Ownes an accomplished livestock and leatherworking business. Is mostly here for the wine and food, but will not get drunk. *Dagnal is an accomplished archer*
* Eldon and Faldren - Male Halfling brothers. Eldon was imprisoned with the party during the prologue. The two of them have conned their way into upper class society on forged art. *Eldon will enter the archery contest, but attempt to win through sabotage*
* Arjhan Daardendrian - Male Dragonborn. The absolutely highest of high-brow nobles. Comes from a long line of artificiers and researchers. Is only here because his wife made him come to "keep up relations". *Arjhan is an accomplished archer*

Note: *Bel'krell is an accomplished archer*

## Events
The majority of the event will be wine tasting and mingling. Makaria will make a grand entrance in a beautiful gown that appears to be burning. Once she notices the players, she'll make a show of calling them the saviors of her vineyard, and saying that the party wouldn't have happened if it weren't for them. She'll make a toast, then bid the party to enjoy the party. She'll mention the wine tasting and the archery contest, possibly pointing out to the interested party which of the nobles are accomplished archers.

There will also be space for dancing, a buffet, and plenty of wine.
