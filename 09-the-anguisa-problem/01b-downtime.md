## Ibal - Buy a Magic Item or Research
Buy Fine clothes 15gp
Buying a Magic Item. Wants to buy a magic weapon. Has a budget of 750gp

https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#BuyingaMagicItem

100gp initial expense. Make a Persuasion roll with +1 for every workweek beyond the first and every 100gp spent beyond the initial fee (up to +10) to find a reputable seller with the item in question.

With a budget of 750, Ibal can make this check with no bonus and afford an Uncommon Magic Item (600gp max). That's enough to afford a simple +1 weapon. Assuming someone in the party doesn't win the Makaria contest and Ibal doesn't obtain the Flame Tongue Longsword that's up for prize.

BACKUP PLAN: Research on psychology and humanoid behavior. No real mechanical goal, but could blossom into a friendship with Baern Frostbeard at the Wizard's College.

## Fran - Training
Wants to gain proficiency in Vehicles (Sailing).

https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#Training

Normally takes 10 workweeks with 25gp per week.
The time is reduced by a number of weeks equal to the character's Int modifier.

Fran's modifier is 0, but with his background as a fisher, I'll cut the time in half. He can take the 4 weeks of downtime to train with Krusk (or whoever), then finish his training during the week-long journey to the Heavenly Cay.
