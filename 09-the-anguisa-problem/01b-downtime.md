Seacracker Islands Lore
1. 1 in 10 ships that make the journey are lost. That number was 1 in 4 until recently. Mostly due to the identification of "safe" routes and special training for ship captains and crews.
2. Bluerim Village exists on an island almost right in the middle of the archipelago. It's a waystation for ships and has a thriving tourist trade.
3. Hazards along the route include whirlpools, pirates, sahuagin, killer whales, griffins, and harpies, but fortunately no LARGE creatures such as krakens or dragon turtles
4. Legend says that the islands were formed when Draffnir, one of the giants who molded the world, fell after his betrayal to the enemy. The impact of his fall shattered the land into the many islands. His head fell far to the west, and he was smiling as he died, which gave rise to the Laughing Mountains.
5. A special species of giant crab makes its home in the southern regions of the islands. It's blood is very valuable in the field of medicine, both mundane and magical
6. There is another legend of a mysterious artifact buried in the southern regions of the islands known as the Middle Point Ring.

The Nature of Black Dragons
1. It is rare for a dragon to have a talent for spellcasting, but their long life and natural aptitude certainly make it possible
2. Many dragons are known to shapeshift, but they usually have a tell. Some physical feature that is common through each of their transformations, such as a scar, eye color, or hair arrangement.
3. Tabitha was telling the truth about being able to concoct many poisons and antidotes from the egg shavings of a black dragon egg. A green dragon egg is better though.
4. Dragons mate for life. It is exceedingly rare for one dragon to maintain its life for long after its mate has died. Those that do usually go mad.
5. There are several records of attempts by humans to raise a dragon. Nearly all of them end in disaster. There is one record of a dragon being raised successfully by a humanoid. An elven witch named Naviina. The dragon reached adulthood having never harmed any humanoid creature. Looks like raising a dragon is possible, although Naviina had to devote her entire life to the process.
6. It is possible to hatch a black dragon egg by submerging it in boiling acid for three days

## Ibal - Buy a Magic Item or Research
Buy Fine clothes 15gp
Buying a Magic Item. Wants to buy a magic weapon. Has a budget of 750gp

https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#BuyingaMagicItem

100gp initial expense. Make a Persuasion roll with +1 for every workweek beyond the first and every 100gp spent beyond the initial fee (up to +10) to find a reputable seller with the item in question.

With a budget of 750, Ibal can make this check with no bonus and afford an Uncommon Magic Item (600gp max). That's enough to afford a simple +1 weapon. Assuming someone in the party doesn't win the Makaria contest and Ibal doesn't obtain the Flame Tongue Longsword that's up for prize.

BACKUP PLAN: Research on psychology and humanoid behavior. No real mechanical goal, but could blossom into a friendship with Baern Frostbeard at the Wizard's College.

## Fran - Training
Wants to gain proficiency in Vehicles (Sailing).

https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#Training

Normally takes 10 workweeks with 25gp per week.
The time is reduced by a number of weeks equal to the character's Int modifier.

Fran's modifier is 0, but with his background as a fisher, I'll cut the time in half. He can take the 4 weeks of downtime to train with Krusk (or whoever), then finish his training during the week-long journey to the Heavenly Cay.

## Valmar - Research
Wants to learn to better control his Wild Magic
Wants to investigate religious life, perhaps with the intention of becoming a cleric

Wild Magic
1. Sorcerers cursed with Wild Magic who attempt to suppress it almost always wind up dying, usually extremely violently
2. Wild Magic manifests through exposure to powerful magical energy. The three main causes are fateful birth circumstances, magical accidents, or being in the presence of a powerful magical being with no protection
3. There is no cure for Wild Magic. There is no recorded case of an individual afflicted with Wild Magic being rid of it without their death.
4. Wild Magic can be suppressed by an experienced sorcerer, but all that will do is delay the release. The subsequent release will be twice as powerful.
