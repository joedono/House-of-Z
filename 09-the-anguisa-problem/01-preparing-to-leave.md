# Preparing to Leave
Th party's next objective is to find Professor Adran Galanodel, who works in the biology and science department of the Ivory Tower in the Heavenly Cay. They need to take care of a little housekeeping, specifically actually hiring a housekeeper, and they need to obtain passage aboard a ship, either their own or by charter.

While they're out there, they might remember to check off the Finger Bones item on their list of locations.

## Housekeeper Interviews
Ardin rolls a 20 on the job posting for housekeeper(s). That's enough to bring in 1-2 people every couple days or so. The party did NOT mention the presence of a fey creature in the house, but did put "further responsibilities to be discussed" on the posting. They asked for a housekeeper, stocker, and cook.

The party can wait around for applicants to show up (which is the common method) or they can set up a mail box for people to drop off applications at.

The party hired the Hansens to house-sit while they trek through the mountains. They'll be collecting the applications while the party is out.

## Applicants
**Feng** - Male half-orc. Used to work as a janitor at the Black Rose Inn (setup for Beneath the Black Rose module). His father, Cecil, owns the inn. Feng is here in Loftran, striking out on his own, plying his trade. He dreams of working for a noble house, and will be a little disappointed when he finds out the party is more of a ragtag group of adventurers. He'll have no problem working in a house with a fey creature, but will unwittingly attract ghosts occasionally. He's good at cleaning and stocking, but horrible at cooking.

Rate - 20gp/month

**Kerri Buckman** - Female human. A middle-aged widow with three grown children (two sons and a daughter). Basically lives alone and is looking for something to keep her busy. She's above-average at cleaning, stocking, and cooking. She **does** have issues working in a house with a fey creature, believing that it'll steal her things or whisk her away to the Feywild while she sleeps. If she isn't told up-front about the Brownie, she'll gradually become suspicious over about a month's time. Sooner if the party makes a mess and it gets cleaned up before she gets to it. One condition for her employment is that at least one guest room must be kept empty in case any of her children come to visit.

Rate - 10gp/month

**Tarhun Turnuroth** - Male dragonborn. A con-man. Presents as an experienced butler with references that are all fake upon investigation. If the party hires him, he'll steal as much as there is to steal (a few pieces of valuable silverware and one painting from the house, and whatever he can get from the players) before vanishing. The brownie will leave a furious note for the players, saying that he had to chase Tarhun out of the mansion. This won't cause Pepper to leave, but she'll be pissed for a little while.

Rate - 10gp/month

**Albert Glendale, Atala Jassan, Althaea Amakiir, and Reed Tosscobble** - Male human, female human, female elf, and male halfling. The former head butler, maid, cook, and groundskeeper from the Elmwall Estate. With their mistress Isabella settling in for an extended (possibly indefinite) stay at the House of Sunlight, and all their masters dead, the four remaining employees of Elmwall are out of work.

Rate - 20gp/month for Albert, 15gp/month for Atala and Althaea each, and 10gp/month for Reed. Total = 45gp/month for all four staffers

## Obtaining a Ship
If the party elects to obtain a ship via their Queen's Boon, then it'll take one month to construct the ship. This can be used for downtime as the party likes: https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#DowntimeActivities

After a month's time, the Queen will offer them a choice between an unfurnished Brigantine that is seaworthy and in good repair, and a [Folding Boat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/folding-boat). She'll take them down to the Giantvein River, which borders Loftran, to present the choice to the party.

If they ask for something else, deal with it accordingly.

## Outfitting the Ship
If the party purchases passage on an existing ship, then they don't need to do this.

If the party goes with the Folding Boat, then it can't really have furnishings or a crew, since there'd be no where to put them after folding the boat back up. All they really have to do is get food and either a map or a guide, since they'll be able to camp on the islands on the way.

If the party obtains a real ship, then they'll have to hire a crew and buy furnishings for it. Hirelings cost 2gp per day. Depending on the type of ship the party requests will make a difference in the size of the crew the party must hire and how many officers they'll need.

## Complications
At some point during the construction of the ship, one of the party will be approached by a pair of hooded figures. This is Zerdan and Daniel Mitsk, two brothers who are attempting to covertly leave the city. They were transformed into Yuan-Ti Purebloods during the ritual of Zehir, but they are lucid and want nothing to do with the god of poison. They don't feel that they can stay in the city due to the intense and sometimes murderous discrimination they'd face. They'll want to enlist the party's help in leaving the city on their ship and going north. The only problem is that they don't want to leave their elderly mother behind, but she can't really move on her own. Cazra Mitsk is still fully human, but completely senile. She hasn't noticed that her sons are part snake, or anything else that happened in the city recently. They offer 300gp, enough for 10gp per person per day for 3 people for 10 days (a week). Daniel has some skill in sailing, so he'll be able to help out as a member of the crew.

Getting the Mitsk's out will take some stealth, as there are now nightly patrols for shadows and Yuan-Ti (among other threats). The party can try to get them out during the day, but the regular folk are just as perceptive as the night watches. Getting them through the city will be a skill challenge, disguising the Mitsks to hide their faces, sneaking around patrols, creating distractions, and not getting lost in the chaos.

The Mitsk's will stick with the party until they discover the Yuan-Ti living with the Grippli near the Heavenly Cay.

## Departing
As soon as the party sets out on this journey, make them Level 6
