# Preparing to Leave
Th party's next objective is to find Professor Adran Galanodel, who works in the biology and science department of the Ivory Tower in the Heavenly Cay. They need to take care of a little housekeeping, specifically actually hiring a housekeeper, and they need to obtain passage aboard a ship, either their own or by charter.

While they're out there, they might remember to check off the Finger Bones item on their list of locations.

## Housekeeper Interviews
Ardin rolls a 20 on the job posting for housekeeper(s). That's enough to bring in 1-2 people every couple days or so. The party did NOT mention the presence of a fey creature in the house, but did put "further responsibilities to be discussed" on the posting. They asked for a housekeeper, stocker, and cook.

The party can wait around for applicants to show up (which is the common method) or they can set up a mail box for people to drop off applications at.

The party hired the Hansens to house-sit while they trek through the mountains. They'll be collecting the applications while the party is out.

## Applicants
**Feng** - Male half-orc. Used to work as a janitor at the Black Rose Inn (setup for Beneath the Black Rose module). His father, Cecil, owns the inn. Feng is here in Loftran, striking out on his own, plying his trade. He dreams of working for a noble house, and will be a little disappointed when he finds out the party is more of a ragtag group of adventurers. He'll have no problem working in a house with a fey creature, but will unwittingly attract ghosts occasionally. He's good at cleaning and stocking, but horrible at cooking.

Rate - 20gp/month

**Kerri Buckman** - Female human. A middle-aged widow with three grown children (two sons and a daughter). Basically lives alone and is looking for something to keep her busy. She's above-average at cleaning, stocking, and cooking. She **does** have issues working in a house with a fey creature, believing that it'll steal her things or whisk her away to the Feywild while she sleeps. If she isn't told up-front about the Brownie, she'll gradually become suspicious over about a month's time. Sooner if the party makes a mess and it gets cleaned up before she gets to it. One condition for her employment is that at least one guest room must be kept empty in case any of her children come to visit.

Rate - 10gp/month

**Tarhun Turnuroth** - Male dragonborn. A con-man. Presents as an experienced butler with references that are all fake upon investigation. If the party hires him, he'll steal as much as there is to steal (a few pieces of valuable silverware and one painting from the house, and whatever he can get from the players) before vanishing. The brownie will leave a furious note for the players, saying that he had to chase Tarhun out of the mansion. This won't cause Pepper to leave, but she'll be pissed for a little while.

Rate - 10gp/month

**Albert Glendale, Atala Jassan, Althaea Amakiir, and Reed Tosscobble** - Male human, female human, female elf, and male halfling. The former head butler, maid, cook, and groundskeeper from the Elmwall Estate. With their mistress Isabella settling in for an extended (possibly indefinite) stay at the House of Sunlight, and all their masters dead, the four remaining employees of Elmwall are out of work.

Rate - 20gp/month for Albert, 15gp/month for Atala and Althaea each, and 10gp/month for Reed. Total = 45gp/month for all four staffers

## Obtaining a Ship
If the party elects to obtain a ship via their Queen's Boon, then it'll take one month to construct the ship. This can be used for downtime as the party likes: https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#DowntimeActivities

The Queen will make whatever sort of ship the party asks for, but it will take a month. She'll also offer them a [Folding Boat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/folding-boat) that she had made. She'll take them down to the Giantvein River, which borders Loftran, to present the choice to the party.

If they ask for something else, deal with it accordingly.

## Outfitting the Ship
If the party purchases passage on an existing ship, then they don't need to do this.

If the party goes with the Folding Boat, then it can't really have furnishings or a crew, since there'd be no where to put them after folding the boat back up. All they really have to do is get food and either a map or a guide, since they'll be able to camp on the islands on the way.

If the party obtains a real ship, then they'll have to hire a crew and buy furnishings for it. Hirelings cost 2gp per day. Depending on the type of ship the party requests will make a difference in the size of the crew the party must hire and how many officers they'll need.

The party has chartered the Sea Spear, captained by Krusk, at the cost of 200gp per person (one-way), leaving in a month's time. It is a three-masted galley ship. The journey will take a week.

## Downtime

### Makaria Resurgence Party
The Makaria Estate is holding a party in just over a week that the players have an invitation to. This is meant to showcase that Makaria is back on the map, as her vineyard has recovered and she is producing wine again.

The party can choose how they'd like to be announced, and Bel'krell will announce them appropriately.

Bart, the groundskeeper will be out front tending to hedges when the party arrives. He'll greet them. If they stop to talk, he'll make a show of how happy he's been lately now that the vineyard is back in business and Baelor isn't pissed all the time (as much). Bart also adopted a new cat that he named Pine after his favorite tree.

Baelor will make some appearances during the party, puffing out his chest at his latest creations: Honey Hellfire, Pursue Sensation, and Cherry Succulent. At some point, he'll overhear a small group of young nobles bad-mouthing the taste of the new wine, calling it "gimmicky", which Baelor will take extreme offense at, possibly instigating a duel.

#### Events
The majority of the event will be wine tasting and mingling. Makaria will make a grand entrance in a beautiful gown that appears to be burning. Once she notices the players, she'll make a show of calling them the saviors of her vineyard, and saying that the party wouldn't have happened if it weren't for them. She'll make a toast, then bid the party to enjoy the party. She'll mention the wine tasting and the archery contest, possibly pointing out to the interested party which of the nobles are accomplished archers.

There will also be space for dancing, a buffet, and plenty of wine.

**Archery Contest**
3 rounds of increasing distance: 60ft, 120ft, 180ft

The Stormbow (https://www.brandesstoddard.com/2017/11/dd-5e-five-magic-bows-and-a-magic-arrow/)
Weapon (any bow), rare (requires attunement)
This magical bow grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with it. When you cast a ranger spell, it grants a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls, and your spell save DC increases by 1. When you fire an evocation Arcane Shot from this bow, you can deal lightning damage instead of any other damage type. If you do, you deal an additional 1d6 lightning damage.
A stormbow has 4 charges. ETA: It regains one charge per hour spent in a thunderstorm, and regains all expended charges at dawn. When you hit with a ranged attack using it, you can expend 1 charge to deal an additional 1d8 lightning damage. When you cast a ranger spell, you can expend 2 charges per spell slot level to double the damage your spell inflicts.
Lore: Stormbows are the signature weapons of the Storm Archers, an elite order of archers who bind lightning to their arrows for devastating effect. They play a deadly game of cat-and-also-cat with the necromantic Bone Archers, all across the Wildlands.

**Consolation Price**
One bottle each of the new Makaria wines. 3 bottles total.
300gp

**Attendees**
Other noble attendees the players might encounter.

* Aiden Collander - Human male. Familiar to the players as a fruit and wine merchant. Has a good relationship with Makaria, but is seen as a lower class noble since he manages his own shop. Still VERY well connected.
* Seebo Timbers - Male gnome. Labor manager. Basically an unskilled worker contract manager. Employs about half the Hatching Stone Miners.
* Peren and Enna Nailo - Male and Female half-elf. Own a textile company that's hit on hard times. Their business includes the warehouse on Linen Street. The very same one the party rescued the Hansens from during the Yuan-Ti Transformation Ritual. They're confident their business will turn around soon. They have a good business relationship with Linda Linen. *Peren is an accomplished archer*
* Patricia Barakas - Human female. Childhood friend of Makaria. Her family owns the Maple Leaves Residence.
* Alfred Barakas - Human male. Patricia's husband. Extremely likely to get drunk and raucous during the party.
* Dagnal Fireforge - Dwarven female. Ownes an accomplished livestock and leatherworking business. Is mostly here for the wine and food, but will not get drunk. *Dagnal is an accomplished archer*
* Eldon and Faldren - Male Halfling brothers. Eldon was imprisoned with the party during the prologue. The two of them have conned their way into upper class society on forged art. *Eldon will enter the archery contest, but attempt to win through sabotage*
* Arjhan Daardendrian - Male Dragonborn. The absolutely highest of high-brow nobles. Comes from a long line of artificiers and researchers. Is only here because his wife made him come to "keep up relations". *Arjhan is an accomplished archer*

Note: *Bel'krell is an accomplished archer*

### Yuan-Ti Refugees
TODO
At some point during the construction of the ship, one of the party will be approached by a pair of hooded figures. This is Zerdan and Daniel Mitsk, two brothers who are attempting to covertly leave the city. They were transformed into Yuan-Ti Purebloods during the ritual of Zehir, but they are lucid and want nothing to do with the god of poison. They don't feel that they can stay in the city due to the intense and sometimes murderous discrimination they'd face. They'll want to enlist the party's help in leaving the city on their ship and going north. The only problem is that they don't want to leave their elderly mother behind, but she can't really move on her own. Cazra Mitsk is still fully human, but completely senile. She hasn't noticed that her sons are part snake, or anything else that happened in the city recently. They offer 300gp, enough for 10gp per person per day for 3 people for 10 days (a week). Daniel has some skill in sailing, so he'll be able to help out as a member of the crew.

Getting the Mitsk's out will take some stealth, as there are now nightly patrols for shadows and Yuan-Ti (among other threats). The party can try to get them out during the day, but the regular folk are just as perceptive as the night watches. Getting them through the city will be a skill challenge, disguising the Mitsks to hide their faces, sneaking around patrols, creating distractions, and not getting lost in the chaos.

The Mitsk's will stick with the party until they discover the Yuan-Ti living with the Grippli near the Heavenly Cay.

## Departing
As soon as the party sets out on this journey, make them Level 6
