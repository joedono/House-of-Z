# Morning in the Church
All through the night, refugees from the carnage outside find their way into the church. The church's resources are stretched thin, but they manage. They have faith that other churches around the city are providing similar aid, as well as the Wizard's College. It's possible that there are survivors at the Seat of War (guard headquarters) as well, but that's on the other side of the city. The players are able to get a full night's rest, as the clerics and their acolytes take turns maintaining the divine light spell throughout the night.


## NPCs

### Brother Kellen
Gnomish Cleric. One of the masters of the House of Sunlight.

### Sister Thia
Half-Elf Cleric. The other master of the House of Sunlight.

### Horsemaster Brom
Dwarf Stablemaster. Maintains a handful of stables in the NW section of town, as well as a horse farm near the edge of town. If the players brought the horses from the stables, Brom will be instantly friendly with them for saving a few of his merchandise. He might jokingly try to charge them for their usage.

### Aiden Collander
Human Merchant. Prominent (and loud) merchant of fresh fruits and fine wines.

### Cathlene Brenther
Human student of wizardry. Lives in the NW section of town, but attends school at the Wizard's College.

### Elena and Kristina
Malcom the guard's wife (widow) and daughter


## Events

### Morning After
The players wake up to a simple, but warm meal being prepared by the exhausted church staff. They see a small group of people sitting in a circle, discussing a course of action. Among them are Brother Kellen and Sister Thia, Horsemaster Brom, Aiden Collander, and Cathlene Brenther. Brom and Aiden are eager to get out as soon as they can to check on their wares. Brom in particular is concerned that his horses didn't survive the night. Cathlene and Kellen are more cautious and advise waiting until after the sun has risen more. Thia is silent. Upon prodding, she is concerned about those green flashes and wonders if the rest of the city is as affected as they were. If the players interrupt or listen in, they can learn that the horses they stole (if they did) belonged to Brom, and he'll expect payment for their use, that Cathlene believes that the sigils were part of a ritual and that there may be more information at the Wizard's College, and that Aiden actually witnessed the sigil last night being activated.

### Grieving Widow
Malcom's wife Elena and daughter Kristina may approach the players and, despite them being criminals under Malcom's charge, will thank them for being with Malcom in his final moments. He always said his greatest fear was to die alone. She'll offer a little extra information. If the players opt to go see what the story is at the Seat of War, Elena will say that Malcom has friends there and if the players hold on to Malcom's ring and present it there, they'll have less trouble speaking to important people. She'll say that if anyone knows the situation across the entire city, it'll be the coordinators at the Seat of War.

### Still Wanted
If they notice him, then Isabella, Bartel, and Issac will confront Ibal one last time before leaving. They'll promise to make his life as difficult as possible, assuming they can't have him arrested again. There are no guards in the church and Kellen and Thia have forbidden any altercations or fights while on the church grounds. They leave in a huff.

### Next Steps
The party has a number of options to investigate at this point:
1. Attempt to locate the sigil that activated last night and see what they find there
2. Go to the Wizard's College to get more information about rituals of this nature
3. Go to the Seat of War to see what the state of the rest of the city is
4. Attempt to locate the killer that committed the murder that Ibal was imprisoned for
