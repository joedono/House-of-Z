# Wizard's College
Acting on the advice of Cathlene Brenther, the party elects to investigate the library at the Wizard's College to see if they can learn anything new about the ritual currently taking place in Loftran.

## NPCs

### Theresa
Young wizard librarian

### High Magus Vilafor
High Magus at the Wizard's College. A stuck-up old geezer who holds the keys to the forbidden section of the wizard's library. He has a familiar named Pookie that he dotes on extensively, with baby-talk and everything.

### Pookie
Vilafor’s faniliar. Usually a sprite. Pookie is sick of all the baby-naming and sick of being talked down to by Vilafor. So sick that she’s likely to give the players the passcode to the Forbidden Section of the Wizard’s Library just to spite Vilafor.

## Events

### Detected Potential
Ardin and Liara/Valmer set off some kind of sensor upon entering the Wizard's College. They are carted off for an "evaluation". They pass, as they have magical aptitude, but are snobbishly denied membership to the college because they use "dirty" magic (natural or inborn).

### Allowed to Browse
The party is allowed to browse the library as they wish. Despite not technically being students, the knowledge is publicly available. Distribution is encouraged, but hard-copies cannot be removed from the premises. Books can be borrowed, but all tomes are enchanted. Three days after removal, the books are automatically magically transported into a "reshelving bin" behind the desk and reshelved to their proper locations. The party can find semi-useful information about spellcasting, the history of Loftran, various works of fiction (mostly about legendary wizards), and the history of the royal family. They initially find nothing about the ritual currently happening in the city.

### Helping Hand
The party is approached by Theresa, a new student at the college doing part-time work in the library. She shows interest in what the party is looking for and reveals that something this sinister will probably be in the forbidden section (of course). Theresa is happy to provide any information about how to get into the section, but she isn't allowed to actually help the party in any way. A DC 15 (20?) Persuasion check can be made to convince her to help anyways, since she's curious about what's in there anyways. She divulges the details of what the players will have to do in order to get into the Forbidden Section. They can either attempt the tests, or attempt to extract the passcode from High Magus Vilafor.

### The Lock of Aptitude
The first lock on the forbidden section is the Lock of Aptitude. Since only wizards are allowed in, the lock requires those desiring entry to present two of the 10 elements: acid, cold, lightning, fire, force, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and thunder. Which elements are required changes weekly, but are posted on a bulletin board next to the entrance. The elements will be fire and cold for the next three days, then they'll switch to something else. Fortunately for the party (maybe don't tell them this part), all they have to do is "present" the element. If they can light a torch in the Aptitude chamber and touch it to the pedestal, that will satisfy the requirement for "fire". It's like the finale of 5th Element.

### The Lock of Resistance
This test is aimed at the party's ability to resist magical mind control. Stepping into the circle will hit the player with a DC 13 *charm person* spell (Theryn and Ibal have advantage). If they fail, they are commanded to attack their friends. Normal rules apply. The first to succeed in resisting the spell opens the door.

### The Lock of Purity
This test should be simple enough for the party, but it's probable that Theresa doesn't know exactly how it works. There will be a stone circle on the floor that will scan the alignment of anyone who enters it. Only those of Neutral Good or Lawful Good alignment will pass this part and open the next door. Liara, Ibal, and Ardin will pass.

### Getting the Passcode from Vilafor
Vilafor is very snotty and discerning in his allowance of who he gives the passcode to. He is the most trusted wizard in the college, which is why he's headmaster. He believes that information should be made available only to those who will not misuse it, but he has a hard time resisting someone expressing a fervent desire for knowledge. He won't just give the passcode to the party, as he believes they either have to be exemplary students of the college already, or pure of heart and mind.

Vilafor’s sprite familiar, Pookie, has had enough of being talked down to and sees the players as an opportunity to spite Vilafor. She’s willing to give the players the passcode if they promise to randomly rearrange as many books as possible. Vilafor likes to browse the Forbidden Section when the library is closed and seeing everything out of order will infuriate him.

### Researching the Ritual
Once inside the forbidden section, the party will be unhindered. Once you're in, everyone assumes you should be allowed in. An Investigation check is needed to do the research. The research should succeed no matter the roll, but the number should determine how many possible explanations the players find and how long it takes them.

If the party has not been to see one of the sigils, they'll have some trouble narrowing down what sort of ritual is taking place in the city. All they know is that it involves green flashes and the appearance of shadow creatures at night. Their research will turn up at least 3 possibilities:

1. The necromancer Albert once attempted to conjure an ancient black dragon from the aether
2. The enchantress Frigga successfully teleported herself and a nearby village to the Abyss
3. The ritual of transformation administered by the Yuan-Ti to convert new followers of Zehir, the Serpent King and God of Poison and Darkness
4. The ritual of calling administered by the Drow to call down the fury of Lolth, Queen of Spiders and Lies, onto their enemies during a great war in ages past
5. A beholder named Hal'droth once attempted to ascend to demi-godhood using a ritual that channeled the power of nature, perverted it, and imbued it into an emerald that he would ingest

1 and 2 are written in Elven. 3 is written in Infernal. 4 and 5 are written in Undercommon (Fran and Theryn speak Undercommon).

Since anyone who has made it in to the Forbidden Section is assumed to have the right to be here, the party is allowed to take notes on what they find. See below if they try to take the books themselves out of the Forbidden Section.

### How to Stop the Ritual
1. Stopped by killing Albert
2. Ritual successful
3. Stopped by destroying the ritual powersource with a weapon of great light and purifying the desecrated ritual ground with a great panacea
4. Stopped by opening a portal to siphon the ritual energy (or perhaps Lolth herself) back to the Abyss
5. Emerald was destroyed with a spell channeling the essence of pure nature

As for how to stop the ritual, the book mentions that destroying the sigils would only delay the ritual, as the effect of "poisoning" the populace and making them ready for the transformation has already happened. The only way to stop this is to find and destroy/disable the ritual's power source. The ritual says that the power source will be a container held at a "seat of great infamy, where the thoughts and minds of mortals turn to daily." This could mean the castle, the Seat of War, one of the prominent churches, etc, etc.

In order to destroy such a power source, the party needs to find a "weapon of great restoration" and a "weapon of great light". Only with the combined powers of restoration (to combat the poison) and light (to combat the darkness) can the ritual be stopped.

### Exit
The players can leave relatively unhindered. If they attempt to take any books out of the Forbidden Section, they are given weird looks, but are not approached. Once they cross the threshold of the Forbidden Section, any books they took vanish from their inventory. One of the other wizard students might approach them and try to give them "newbie" advice. He'll start talking about how everyone attempts that at some point, but there's nothing to be done. Forbidden books cannot leave the library.
