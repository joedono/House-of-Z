# Seat of War
With Elena's help, the party elects to attempt to get a report on what the situation is in the rest of the city from the headquarters of the city watch, the Seat of War.

## NPCs

### Harold and Byron
Two soldiers who were not affected by the calming effects of the sigil and thus have been quarantined into the Trauma Ward due to their "insane" ramblings about shadows that tear and bite.

## Events

### Arrival
The general mood at the Seat of War is confused inaction. A lot of the soldiers here are fully armed (or almost) and appear to be awaiting orders beyond "sit tight and wait for orders." If the players visit here in the morning, there are many soldiers coming back from some mission the night before. If asked about it, none of them will really remember why they were out all night or why they're so tired. They'll mention that they think something happened to their comrades (There should be more of us), but they won't be overly concerned about it. "I'm sure they'll be back soon." Further investigation will reveal to the players that there's a "trauma ward" downstairs where the injured are taken. There are a couple soldiers down there who weren't affected by the sigils the night before and are raving about "shadows that bite and tear."

### Getting into the Trauma Ward
The party has no trouble finding the entrance to the trauma ward, but it's guarded. The only people allowed in are physicians, healers, and commanding officers. If Liara is there, she can demonstrate her healing ability and the party will be allowed in. Otherwise, they'll have to find a way to bluff their way past. Given Liara's demonic body, the guards won't believe her if she just says she's a healer. A demonstration will be necessary.

### Trauma Ward
The inside of the trauma ward is heartwrenching. There are tons of beds here, and all either have still bodies in them or bloody sheets. A handful of the still bodies are actually still alive, just catatonic. There are two soldiers who are awake, but they're raving and require some mental grounding before they'll be able to give any useful information to the party. A DC 20 Persuasion check or a sound hit across the head will be enough, but the party can be creative about this.

### Interview with Sanity
Once lucid, the two soldiers introduce themselves as Harold (human) and Byron (dwarf). They were stationed on patrol in different parts of the city. Byron was near a green flash the night before last, and Harold was near the flash last night. Their stories are basically the same: they rushed to the scene with their squadrons and found a massacre. People being butchered by shadows come alive, and then their shadows rising to claim more victims. Byron attempted to fight, but felt his strength drain as he swung his ax. He blacked out and woke up here. Harold fled and hid in an alley. A shadow found him and he similarly blacked out. He woke up screaming and running to the Seat of War, carrying the unconscious body of one of his squad mates. They were both committed to the trauma ward. Both express extreme frustration that no one seems to believe them about the events they lived through. Finally, Harold and Byron give the party enough information to locate the two sigils they know about, should the party elect to investigate them.

### Locked in here with You
Upon mentioning the unconscious soldier that Harold brought back, his gaze will shift to a soldier on a nearby bed who looked like he was sleeping. As the party watches, the soldier's breath will slow and then stop. The sheets under the soldier are soaked with blood. Examining the body will reveal serious injuries, but no missing organs. Once he passes, Byron will begin to panic, fearing that a shadow demon will rise from the corpse. If the party sticks around, or leaves Byron and Harold here, their fear will come true and the party might later learn that Byron and Harold were found dead in the Trauma Ward. The official story will be suicide.

### Escape
Harold and Byron cannot leave by themselves, since they're seen as insane and a danger to themselves and those around them. They'll beg the party for help getting out. The party has a couple of options, one or more of which might be suggested by Harold or Byron themselves if the party cannot decide. If the party got into the ward because they have a healer, they can take Harold and Byron out under the guise of bringing them to the church for blessing, restoration, or exorcism. They'll be let out unhindered this way. Harold and Byron can pretend to be dead, and the party can bluff about taking them to be buried. If the party can provide enough reassurance, Harold and Byron can hide their fear and unstable mental state long enough to convince the guards outside that they are sane and can return to duty. They'll have to last long enough without cracking to get outside. Finally, the players can wait until the shadow demon arrives, and either kill it or attempt to use it as proof that Harold and Byron weren't insane. Killing the shadow will allay Harold and Byron's fears and let them sleep better at night, but they won't be let out. The rest of the guards have the same nonchalant attitude as the rest and won't believe their own eyes if they see a shadow demon.

### Last Eavesdropping
As the party leaves, they can chance to overhear new orders being issued. The commanders are ordering their squadrons to go out and quell any "dissidents" spreading harmful rumors about monstrous attacks throughout the city. These dissidents are to be considered traitors and arrested post-haste. Any that resist are considered enemies of the crown and lethal force is authorized in dealing with them. Further evidence that the crown is in on the ritual, or maybe being affected by it.
