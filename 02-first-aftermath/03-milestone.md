# Milestone - Pooling Information
Hopefully, the players have gathered what information they can from the sigil, the wizard's college, and the seat of war. They now know a few things:

## Information Obtained so Far

### Investigating the Sigil
1. The sigils have the effect of making the people near them refuse to believe that anything bad is happening.
2. (Friend) The party has a new recruit. The kid Marsh Hansen will follow them whether they want him or not.

### Wizard's College
1. The sigils are being drawn and the ritual is being cast by the members of the Venomers, a cult loyal to Zehir, the serpent god of poison and darkness
2. The sigils are part of a grand ritual, either to transport the city to the plane of Zehir or transform the citizens of the city into his loyal subjects.
3. Destroying the sigils themselves will only slow the ritual down
4. The way to stop the ritual is to locate and destroy the power source
5. The power source is located somewhere that's a "seat of great infamy, where the thoughts and minds of mortals turn to daily." Basically, this means "somewhere famous".
6. In order to destroy the power source, the players need a "weapon of great restoration" and a "weapon of great light".
7. (Friend) The party befriended a young librarian named Theresa
8. (Enemy) The party may have swindled classified information out of High Magus Vilafor.

### Seat of War
1. The military in the city has been ordered to put down any resistance to the completion of the ritual, naming those who speak out that anything bad is happening as traitors and authorizing deadly force when dealing with them.
2. (Friend) The party made a couple friends in Byron and Harold, two soldiers who weren't affected by the calming spell in the sigils and were seen as insane.

## Next Objectives
1. Obtain the "weapon of great restoration"
2. Obtain the "weapon of great light"
3. Locate and destroy the ritual power source

## Level Up
If you haven't already, now would be a good time to have the players level up

## Other Notes
The party has, thus far, witnessed or heard about 6 sigil activations:

1. Discussions of rumors of murder by Malcom and Caleb the second day in prison
2. Witnessed one being activated their second night in prison
3. Witnessed one being activated their third night in prison, which leads to their escape. Near Aiden's shop.
4. The one activated near Marsh's house, which spawned the shadows that killed his family
5. The one Byron was stationed near
6. The one Harold was stationed near

Whether one or more of these are actually the same sigil is up to you, DM, but the players are likely to think they're all separate. At least one will have to spawn in the south, so it affects the farmers. Either way, it doesn't matter, time will slide in a way that gives them time to obtain both weapons and get back just as the ritual is nearing completion. The point is not the number of sigils, but the area of their effect. The cultists need enough sigils to cover the entire city.
