# Night Falls
Night is falling as the party progresses in their investigation. You can throw this in whenever depending on how long it takes the party to complete the stages of investigation from the day. No sigil will activate tonight, but the shadow demons will rise and claim more victims.

## Objective
The players have to find some place safe to bunker down for the night. The most likely place they'll choose is the House of Sunlight, but the Seat of War and the Wizard's College are also options.

If they choose the House of Sunlight, they'll be safe for the night and able to get a full rest. They'll notice that more people have decided to stay here. The church has room for everyone tonight, but Kellen and Thia worry that they won't be able to hold everyone if this crisis continues.

If they choose the Wizard's College, they'll have to choose a hiding spot on campus, as they're not allowed into the dorms and students aren't allowed to sleep anywhere else.

If they choose the Seat of War, they can probably sleep in the barracks, but there'll be an attack that the soldiers are ill-prepared for. The shadow demons are looking for those who haven't been affected by the sigil, and the cultists can affect the will of those poisoned by the sigils, meaning that the players will have to contend with possessed city soldiers.


## Events

### Sleep Tight
Sleeping at the House of Sunlight won't present any problems, but the players will notice that more and more people are coming here for the night. It's only the second night, so there won't be any complications with the belltower.

### Magical Bunkmates
Sleeping at the Wizard's College will also be safe, as it has its own safeguards, but the players will have to contend with campus security. Possible hiding spots:
1. The Harmonious Growth - Campus park and forest. Easy to hide in to avoid campus security, but the trees can come alive at night. One will have to be subdued to provide a safe space for the players to camp.
2. The Forbidden Archive - If the players want to tackle the gateways guarding the forbidden section of the Wizard's Library, they can hide out inside for the night and be completely safe.
3. The Dorms - If the players can locate Theresa again, she'll offer to let the party stay with her. She's an honor student, which means she lives in a suite that can change size and grow extra rooms without taking up any more space.

### The Barraks
Sleeping at The Seat of War is the most dangerous, second to sleeping outside without protection of course. Staying there means that the players will be attacked by possessed soldiers who were affected by the sigil on previous nights. If the players try to stay here after being attacked, they'll have to contend with almost the entire army. Harold and/or Byron can be used to try to guide them out and to the relative safety of the night or some secret sanctuary in the Trauma Ward, which can be barred and locked.
