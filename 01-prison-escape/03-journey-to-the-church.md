# Journey to the Church
Now with a place of safety in mind, the players must make their way to the Church of Pelor while avoiding dark areas in the city. Considering that it's night and there's some force going around snuffing out the torches and other lights in the city, the party doesn't have much time before they are overwhelmed by Shadows.

This will probably mostly be a skill challenge.

## Events

### Faster Travel
The players run past a stable full of horses. The interior is well-lit...for now. There are four living horses still stabled, enough for everyone to get a ride if some of them double up, but they have to move fast. There is one dead horse that has just spawned a Shadow that will attempt to kill the other horses before moving on to humans.

### Just Desserts
A door to a house bursts open just as the players run past. Out stumbles Caleb, the sadistic prison guard. The interior of his house is pitch black and he screams as two Shadows emerge from inside and approach him. He might scream to the party for help, begging forgiveness, maybe even claiming it was all just a joke. The players can attempt to save him, or leave him to his fate.

Encounter - Shadow x2

### Sigil Activated
If the party elects to investigate the green pillar of light, they'll find a circular scorch mark in the ground, with two intertwining lines curving around inside it, along with two Cultists resting after activating it. A DC 15 Religion check will identify it as the mark of the Venomers, a cult dedicated to worshiping Zehir, the Great Serpent and the Master of Poisons and Shadows. A DC 25 Religion check made by a character with the ability to channel divinity or a DC 30 Arcana check will successfully destroy the sigil and prevent any more Shadows from appearing in this area, although the players have no idea how many more of these sigils are working right now.

Encounter - Cultist x4

### Arrival at the Church
The party successfully arrives at the church, where the clergy are attempting to maintain a divine barrier at the threshold. Depending on player fatigue, there might be a mission here to climb to the top of the church and ring the bell to activate the church's innate defenses. Otherwise, and several wizards and druids are maintaining either Light or a Daylight spell to keep the interior illuminated. Dozens of refugees are huddled up here, hoping that the defenses will last until morning. Without the party's help, they won't.
