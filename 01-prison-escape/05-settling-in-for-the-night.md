# Settling in for the Night
With the church's defenses shored up for the night, the party can take a rest in safety.

## Events

### Mingling
Several NPCs the party knows of are here.
* Malcom's wife Elena and daughter Kristina
* Eldon and his brother, Faldren, provided he survived the escape from the prison. Otherwise the players find Faldren crying by himself.
* Isabella, Bartel, and Issac, the wife and two sons of Ibal's murder victim (possible altercation)

Once everyone settles down and plays out whatever they want to play out, the party settles down here for the night and takes a long rest to wait for the relative safety of the rising sun.


## Total Possible EXP
3 Shadows in the prison (3 x 100xp)
2 Cultists in the street (2 x 25xp)
2 Shadows in the belltower (2 x 100xp)
1 Cult Fanatic in the belltower (1 x 450xp)

Total: 1000
5 Players
300xp per player to advanced to level 2
1000 / 5 = 200
Conclusion: Players could level up after activating the belltower and resting at the church, probably depending on how many optional encounters they dealt with.
