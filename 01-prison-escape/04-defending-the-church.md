# Defending the Church
The players have made it to the church, but it's defenses are failing. They must climb to the top and ring the church bell to activate the divine power stored under the church. That will fuel a Sunlight spell that has been woven into the very stone of the church, and cause it to become a beacon of light against the night. Unfortunately, the way to the churchbell is exposed to the outside and the guards previously sent this way haven't returned. It is likely that the catwalk is swarming with shadow demons. The players will need a key to unlock the mechanism that prevents the bell from moving. Kellen had given a key to one of the guards that was sent up. The players will have to locate it.


## Events

### Divine Assistance
Before the party ventures up the stairs, Sister Thia and a couple acolytes call for the party to wait. They perform a quick divine ritual that restores all of the party's HP and gives them the benefits of a short rest, which restores any STR they lost to the Shadow's Strength Drain ability. They apologize that they can't do more, and go back to maintaining the church's defenses.

### Guards Bodies
The party will progress up to the exit outside unhindered. Upon exiting outside onto a rooftop with the bell mechanism, they will find the corpses of two guards. Searching them will turn up no key. Upon the players realizing this, the next event triggers.

### Stolen
A voice will call out, "Looking for this?" The party will see a Cult Fanatic dangling the key in front if it. They'll now have to battle to get the key before more shadow demons show up. At least two shadow demons rise from the corpses of the guards.

Encounter - Shadow x2, Cult Fanatic x1
Map - 2-House-of-Sunlight-Belltower

### Success
Players can spend an action to use the key to unlock the mechanism or a DC 15 Athletics check to break it open. There will be two locked gears, one on either side of the room, that need to be unlocked. After that, a player can spend an action to pull on the rope in the middle of the arena to ring the bell and activate the defenses. The stones will shine with holy daylight as the entire church lights up. All shadow demons are dispelled, and the Cult Fanatic that was holding the key either vanishes, is burned, has already been killed, or escaped. With the church now safe, the players can return into the common room and settle down for the night.


## Encounters
Shadow demons pour in from every side as the players battle to obtain the key.
