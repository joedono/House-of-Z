# Aftermath
The party has pulled the plug on the ritual to convert the citizens of Loftran. The sigils will stop pumping out transformative energy and gradually shut down. The people with Stage 5 symptoms or lower will gradually return to normal. Anyone higher will likely be driven underground, out of the city, or imprisoned.

## Finding the Royal Family
While emerging from the ritual area and exploring the castle, a secret wall will open near the players. This is the door to the royal family's magically warded panic room. When the followers of Zehir started appearing and took over the castle, the king stuffed his family in there for safety. The room is heavily magically warded, so the sigil energy wouldn't have gotten in there. The king himself is no where to be found. His family includes his Queen Amafrey, their eldest son Sigurd, and two young daughters Marta and Selise. Once the queen has overcome her panic at not being able to find her husband, she'll assume leadership and cleanup (so the players don't have to). She'll reward them after she's had time to clean up, although they might have to convince her of their involvement, since they're not guards, wizards, or wearing uniforms of any kind.

## Exploring the City
This will depend on the time of day. If it's day, there won't be much happening. The players might see some snake-eyed people revert to normal. There might be a few zealots trying to advertise conversion, but they're ignored. As the party watches, city guard will come to take them away.

If it's night though, there will be violence everywhere. This time, the side of light is winning though. The party will probably be attacked directly by shadow creatures. They'll be stronger than the default shadows, but weaker than the shadow drakes/snakes the players encountered while rescuing Kellen and within the castle.

## Downtime
The party will have a day of downtime while Queen Amafrey deals with mopping up the city.

## Reward
The players will be invited to a fantastic party thrown by the queen. They'll be hailed as the saviors of the city. They'll be given a mansion in the inner ring and one favor from the crown (within reason). That should be interesting.

### Mansion
The mansion used to belong to a noble family named Eloreth, an elven family that recently abandoned their position in the city to pursue ventures in other regions in the world. It was all rather mysterious, actually. The place will be dingy, but serviceable, and with signs of a sudden departure. It'll be a lot easier to maintain with staff, but it's unlikely that the party can afford that right now.

While exploring the mansion, the party will discover a door that has been locked with a 9th level Arcane Lock spell, which is currently beyond the magic of anyone in the party or the city. However, it can be opened with a password. The clues for the password are written in elvish on a piece of parchment nailed above the door.

```
Be ye friend or be ye foe?
Speak my name, or you'll never know.
Leave me a drink, or a plate of treats
and I'll keep your mansion nice and neat.
```

The required name is Pepper Orangepearl, and belongs to the brownie to lives behind the locked door in the residence. He'll only come out when the mansion is deserted, and he'll clean everything. He'll leave a clue to his name each time the party leaves out treats or a drink, leaves, and comes back. The clues will be pepper, an orange, and a pearl. Speaking the name will open the door and reveal a secret room. The room has a teleportation circle that the magic users in the party can memorize the sigil sequence for, an arcane laboratory with many books, alchemical supplies, a magic item or three, and the making of the portal. This was actually what happened to the previous owner of the mansion. They opened a portal to the Abyss and disappeared through it.

## Missing King
The king of Loftran is missing. The queen will impart onto the players a quest to go find him. He's been taken by Viserion, the ancient black dragon who was behind the Loftran transformation ritual as well as the destruction of Ardin's tribe. He needs the king for something in his blood. He's also behind the murder of Archebald Elmwall, the corruption of Isaac and Bartel Elmwall, and the torture and maiming of Isabella Elmwall. He's been masquerading as Isabella for months.
