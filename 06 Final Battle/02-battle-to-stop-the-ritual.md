# Battle to Stop the Ritual
The party has reached the floor where the ritual to transform Loftran is being powered. They've fought their way past the guards and magical traps laid out for them in the castle. Now they must destroy the ritual power source and defeat Sisava and his minions in order to save the city.

## Final Battle Idea
The area where the ritual is taking place is well lit by candles and torches. There will probably be a small army of snake and yuan-ti minions along with Sisava himself. When Sisava is dropped to half health (or at a dramatic point in the story), he'll cast a gust spell that blows out all the candles. Through their darkvision, the party will see Sisava be consumed by what used to be his shadow, and rise as a much darker version of himself. As the transformation completes, a Darkness spell will encompass the area, preventing any light from appearing and preventing characters with simple darkvision from seeing (Ardin and Sisava will likely be the only ones immune to this). Blowing up the Large Hatching Stone will dispel the Darkness spell, but Sisava will remain an enhanced shadow, capable of walking in sunlight if he is allowed to escape.

## Final Battle

### Sisava - Phase 1
Sisava is a Yuan-Ti abomination - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yuan-ti-abomination

He is accompanied by:
- one or more Shadow Dragons - https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/monsters-d#ShadowDragonTemplate
- many snake minions
  - Constrictor Snake - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/constrictor-snake
  - Flying Snake - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/flying-snake
  - Poisonous Snake - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/poisonous-snake
  - Swarm of Poisonous Snakes - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/swarm-of-poisonous-snakes

### Sisava - Phase 2
Combine Sisava with the Shadow Dragon template. Basically, fix him in Snake form, give him a fly speed of 60, and the Shadow Breath attack

#### Shadow Breath
Any damage-dealing breath weapon possessed by the dragon deals necrotic damage instead of its original damage type. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead shadow rises from its corpse and acts immediately after the dragon in the initiative count. The shadow is under the dragon’s control.

Use the Young White Dragon as a template for the breath attack - https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/young-white-dragon

Cold Breath (Recharge 5–6)
The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Legendary Actions (3/round)
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Bite Attack - The dragon makes a bite attack

Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions) - The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
