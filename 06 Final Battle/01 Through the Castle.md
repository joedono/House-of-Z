# Through the Castle
Through one avenue or another, the party has made it inside Loftran Castle. They must survive the hazards inside and make it upstairs to the Observatory, where the ritual is being powered.

## First Floor
The first floor is full of partygoers who have all been affected by the ritual. All manner of people will be here. If the players are not concealed or disguised, then the guards will attack them directly as soon as they are spotted. The nobles will function as extra eyes that could detect them or general hazards (moving through the crowd is difficult terrain). The king is no where to be found though.

## Second Floor
The second floor will have magical wards, traps, and more beastial shadow creatures for the players to battle through.

Seed a mixture of Yuan-Ti Malisons, every sort of snake, Shadows, and Shadow Demons on the second floor, as well as a smattering of magical wards and traps.
