# Ancient Text
From bio - I have an ancient text that holds terrible secrets that must not fall into the wrong hands

Liara's ancient book was lost when Valmer's magic went awry and merged them into his body. She'll have to search for it and keep it safe. She has a medallion left by one of the thieves. It has the mark of Zehir on it, which will eventually lead her to finding it among the Venomers, who are attempting to poison Loftran.

Her book is now in Viserion's possession. He needs the True Resurrection spell from inside it in order to bring his mate, Anguisa, back to life. She's been dead too long for normal resurrection magic. He needs to collect enough of her essence in order to attempt the ritual. He has been unable to locate her soul due to it being imprisoned in Valmar/Liara's head.

The first opportunity to resolve this will be in The Heavenly Cay. Viserion will be there when the party gets there, disguised as the bumbling halfling apprentice, Rion Blackspice. There is a decent chance the party will see Liara's book among Rion's possessions while they are in the city.
