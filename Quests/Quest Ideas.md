# Quest Ideas

## Eloreth Bank Account
20,000gp in an unclaimed account at the bank in Loftran. Need the Eloreth signet ring. The ring is actually in the Abyss, where half the Eloreth family was massacred and the other half was turned into demons.

## Wild Magic Brother
Have the party encounter a sorcerer who attempted to suppress their Wild Magic only to have it go completely crazy.

## Eliza Long's Daughter
Eliza Long, one of the villains of Beneath the Black Rose, mentioned her missing daughter multiple times. Eliza was murdered 50 years ago. The module doesn't mention her daughter at all, so it's up to me to come up with something about this.

## Poddrick's Debt
Fran found his old fishing buddy, Poddrick, in a Durrstaft prison cell. Without giving any thought to why he might be there, Fran threw him the keys to his cell. The party had created a pretty substantial distraction already, so Poddrick will have no problem escaping. He might contact Fran again and ask if there's a way he can repay Fran for helping him escape. However, Poddrick has an ulterior motive for getting involved with Fran again.

## Jewel Thief
Over the course of his tenure as a city guard consultant, Ibal discovered that, once about every 4 months, a jewelry store in Loftran is robbed. The robber never leaves any trace, and only steals less than 100gp worth of stuff at a time. The jeweler has submitted numerous reports to the city watch, but they can never find anything and continuously dispose of the reports when the trail goes cold, so no one has really noticed the pattern.
