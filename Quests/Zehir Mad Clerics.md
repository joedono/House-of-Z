## Zehir Mad Clerics
Several Yuan-Ti rolled into a village and massacred the population. They were repelled by the local militia, but one retreated into the local church, where it... did something to the people in the church. The clerics came outside some time later, holding blackened pieces of scaled flesh. They looked sad and....broken. The next day, the clerics didn't allow anyone into the church the next day. Every few days ever since, broken strangers would arrive at the town, one or two at a time. They'd head for the church and be allowed inside. The mayor has no idea what's going on inside that church, and wants to hire adventurers to investigate. The clerics are armed and have enough numbers to match the town militia, so they need help.

The clerics have begun wearing strange arm-bands to signify their order. A Religion check will reveal it to be completely non-religious, not belonging to any particular order. A Medicine check will reveal it to be an ancient alchemical symbol for poison. The clerics didn't know, but don't seem to mind upon finding out.

There's a noble scholar who has also been trying to gain entrance into the church, but with the offer to repair and translate some of the ancient texts in the church's library that deal with its founding, as well as the mysterious new god the clerics are worshiping (Zehir/Viserion). He will succeed the day before the party attempts to gain entrance into the church.

The inside is full of sacrilegious images and stinks of decay and death. A group of clerics stand guard outside the church and don't take kindly to visitors of any sort. They're armed with knives and dark magic.

Other little sigils have started appearing in the town too. Carved into fenceposts and the sides of buildings. It's the alchemical symbol for lead, denoting transformation and the harvest. The other priests are carving them.

The noble scholar is actually looking for something specific inside the church, that he believes to be in the basement. The noble is actually a magician. He's confident that the thing he's looking for has nothing to do with the visitor and the other problems. The thing he's looking for is the Infinite Corridor, or rather, a way into it. The Infinite Corridor is the nexus of most portals, and has doorways that lead to all other realms, including the Abyss. The noble lost someone he loved through the Corridor. The noble believes that one such portal is under the church. It's very likely that the Yuan-Ti that entered the church never left, or rather, didn't have to leave through the front door.

There is a pile of books in one corner. One of the books has a cover that looks like skin. It's a monster manual, cataloging different kinds of night creatures, specifically how to create them. A couple of the pages are ripped out. The missing pages have to do with resurrection and pulling souls out of hell.

In the basement of the church, the night creature who fled into it has been crucified. It's blood has been spilling out onto the floor, and strange plants are growing out of it. It is still alive. It's been corrupting the clerics, convincing them to perform a ritual to bring hell to earth. It's basically sitting on top of the doorway to the Infinite Corridor.

The noble will be very excited by what he finds in the books. This sort of transformation or transportation ritual has been attempted here before, and as a side effect, many mysteries of alchemy in general were very close to being solved, but were never taken to completion in the right ways. How disappointed he feels.

The judge is willing to lend his militia to take care of the mad monks while the party breaks through to deal with the night creature. It'll take him until tonight to get everything ready. Of course, that night will also be when the ritual is prepared and can start.

When the ritual starts ,the mark engulfs the houses in hellfire, and funnels the souls of the occupants to the night creature in the church. At this point, the clerics storm out of the church, attacking anyone who was already staged to attack. The night creature absorbs the souls and uses the power to force the passageway to the Infinite corridor open, and more night creatures use it to enter the church. The night creatures then invade the town and attack militia and clerics alike.

The night creature in the basement will use a portion of the absorbed souls to force the portal open and keep it that way. Hell, and Dracula, are on the other side. The noble thinks he can close it, but the beefed up night creature isn't going to make it easy to concentrate, nor will the reinforcements coming from the portal. The main night creature is using the absorbed souls to regenerate HP.

The head cleric, overcome with confusion and regret, flees into the night, killing the judge on his way out.

Once the night creature is weakened, the noble will abandon his attempt to close the portal, and use his seeing stone to interrupt the spell keeping the portal open to redirect it to find his lost love instead. Then the noble will jump through the portal himself. With a final word of thanks, the noble closes the portal from the other side. The stress causes the church to collapse, leaving the party with little time to escape.

Outside, the barely alive judge tells the party where to find the last cleric, and asks them to burn his house down. The party can track the cleric through the woods to an apple tree where there's a spike pit waiting for him. The spike pit is full of bones, including small ones.

Inside the judge's house is a key on a table, and a locked door behind a curtain. Inside the room are tiny shoes... children's shoes. Turned out that the judge enjoyed "little pleasures" in life. Turns out seeing him send that little boy to the apple tree after telling him not to go running around was significant after all.
