# Fran Werewolf
Fran has been a werewolf for a year and change in-game-time. I've been avoiding having him transform mid-adventure because I don't know how that would work. So let's plan something.

The main questions are:
1. How big/long of a quest will subduing Fran be?
2. What will Sal do while Fran is a werewolf?

## Other Affected Events
Depending on when this happens, it would be a good tie-in to have King Samuel transform at the same time. Then Loftran might already be wrecked by the time the players get back there.

## The Situation
The full moon is imminent. Fran's werewolf urges have been boiling close to the surface. He's on the verge of losing control. The only question is, when?

## Summary
We switched around Fran's lycanthropy curse. He took a level in Barbarian to get access to Beastial Rage. We also gave him access to the Loup Garou stat block https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1680932-loup-garou.

We decided to stop with the saving throws and just have Joe decide when would be cinematically appropriate for Fran to transform. He'll retain control of himself when he goes out-of-control and attacks the other players.
