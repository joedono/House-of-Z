# Fran Werewolf
Fran has been a werewolf for a year and change in-game-time. I've been avoiding having him transform mid-adventure because I don't know how that would work. So let's plan something.

The main questions are:
1. How big/long of a quest will subduing Fran be?
2. What will Sal do while Fran is a werewolf?

## Other Affected Events
Depending on when this happens, it would be a good tie-in to have King Samuel transform at the same time. Then Loftran might already be wrecked by the time the players get back there.

## The Situation
The full moon is imminent. Fran's werewolf urges have been boiling close to the surface. He's on the verge of losing control. The only question is, when?
