# Deathbringers
The party received a letter of recommendation from Victor and Naomi Brisly after assisting them with the ghost of Eliza Long. They were instructed to seek out a tiefling named Hope in the Heavenly Cay if they wished to pursue membership.

The Deathbringer HQ is located in The Gilded Circle, the south-eastern district of The Heavenly Cay. Hope will make herself known soon after the party inquires about her. The headquarters isn't really a secret, but it presents itself as a mercenary industry rather than an order devoted to destroying undead. There's a good chance someone here will have heard about Anguisa's release and have a hunting party out looking for clues.
