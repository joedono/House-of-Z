# Meeting Adran
Purple Lotus - Restaurant where the party is talking with Adran. High-end "new age" restaurant with a LARGE selection of teas and almost no meat on the menu

Lester's Leathers - Leatherworking shop that specializes in saddles, packs, and other equipment for livestock

Adran will examine Liara/Valmar/Anguisa. He'll have similar findings to Baern from the Wizard's College, but he'll be more fully confident in his "extract & contain" procedure. His "treated blood extraction process" can be adapted to home in on the soul and draw it out, since it works on all "essences" within a body. Unfortunately, the process requires specially treated giant crab blood in order to mark the desired essence for extraction. Adran will mention that the same procedure was used in a bygone era to extract the Blood of the Giants from those descended from the giants who created the world. The party might remember that "Blood of the Giants" was on that list they found in Loftran.

## Deathbringers
A member of the Deathbringers, a male human named Vesimir, will happen to be at the Purple Lotus while the party is there talking with Adran and will overhear them talking about their Anguisa problem. The party has a decent chance to notice him leave in a hurry. If they follow him, he'll likely notice and attempt to escape. If they manage to stay on his trail or corner him, he'll admit to being a Deathbringer about to bring news of what he learned to Hope. All the way out in the Gilded Circle district.

Vesimir is a light-skinned man with long blond hair and a tattoo of a raven on his neck, a symbol of worship for the Raven Queen.

## Setting off towards Grippli
The Ivory Tower's supply of giant crab blood has run out, and they've stopped receiving their usual shipments from the Grippli trading post to the south, along with Adran's favorite crab meat dish. If the party can travel south and find out why the Grippli have stopped sending crab blood and meat to The Heavenly Cay, he'll be happy to help them. He'll have heard of a band of Yuan-Ti that sailed that way some weeks ago, around the time that the supplies stopped.

-- BOOKMARK --

### Getting to the Trading Post
The Grippli Trading Post is 90 miles, or a day and a half's journey by ship, to the south. The party needs to charter a boat to take them there. The party can ask Captain Krusk if he's willing to loan out a boat and crew for the journey. The party will find Brocc lounging on the dock. Brocc will be willing to loan the party the Folding Boat and a map of the route to the trading post, but he won't be willing to loan any crew, saying that between Fran and Theryn and the map, the party should be able to make the journey themselves. And between Ardin and Valmar, they shouldn't have any need for ship-to-ship weapons.

If the party protests, Brocc will instead offer one of the canoes, which is outfitted with a ballista. It might be a little hardier than the Folding Boat, but not nearly as convenient. He'll still refuse to send any crew along, claiming that this should be Fran's "true final test".

### Other Options
If the party insists on taking some crew with them, Brocc will suggest another crew. The crew of the Mermaid Tail is leaving tomorrow morning for Durrstaft. Maybe the party can barter for them to stop off at the Grippli Trading Post. The ship is captained by a female human named Francine. She'll refuse initially, but will be willing to put her crew and ship out of their way to take the party to the trading post for 500gp per person, and she won't wait around for them to finish up whatever it is they want to do. The party will have to find their own way back.

And thus starts the **Book of Cylinders**
