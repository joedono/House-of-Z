# Meeting Adran
Purple Lotus - Restaurant where the party is talking with Adran. High-end "new age" restaurant with a LARGE selection of teas and almost no meat on the menu

Lester's Leathers - Leatherworking shop that specializes in saddles, packs, and other equipment for livestock

Adran will examine Liara/Valmar/Anguisa. He'll have similar findings to Baern from the Wizard's College, but he'll be more fully confident in his "extract & contain" procedure. His "treated blood extraction process" can be adapted to home in on the soul and draw it out, since it works on all "essences" within a body. Unfortunately, the process requires specially treated giant crab blood in order to mark the desired essence for extraction. Adran will mention that the same procedure was used in a bygone era to extract the Blood of the Giants from those descended from the giants who created the world. The party might remember that "Blood of the Giants" was on that list they found in Loftran.

## Deathbringers
A member of the Deathbringers, a male human named Vesimir, will happen to be at the Purple Lotus while the party is there talking with Adran and will overhear them talking about their Anguisa problem. The party has a decent chance to notice him leave in a hurry. If they follow him, he'll likely notice and attempt to escape. If they manage to stay on his trail or corner him, he'll admit to being a Deathbringer about to bring news of what he learned to Hope. All the way out in the Gilded Circle district.

Vesimir is a light-skinned man with long blond hair and a tattoo of a raven on his neck, a symbol of worship for the Raven Queen.

## Setting off towards Grippli
The Ivory Tower's supply of giant crab blood has run out, and they've stopped receiving their usual shipments from the Grippli village to the south, along with Adran's favorite crab meat dish. If the party can travel south and find out why the Grippli have stopped sending crab blood and meat to The Heavenly Cay, he'll be happy to help them. He'll have heard of a band of Yuan-Ti that sailed that way some weeks ago, around the time that the supplies stopped.

And thus starts the **Book of Cylinders**
