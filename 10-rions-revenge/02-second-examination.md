# Second Examination
Adran will examine Liara/Valmar/Anguisa. He'll have similar findings to Baern from the Wizard's College, but he'll be more fully confident in his "extract & contain" procedure. His "treated blood extraction process" can be adapted to home in on the soul and draw it out, since it works on all "essences" within a body. Unfortunately, the process requires specially treated giant crab blood in order to mark the desired essence for extraction. Adran will mention that the same procedure was used in a bygone era to extract the Blood of the Giants from those descended from the giants who created the world. The party might remember that "Blood of the Giants" is on that list they found in Loftran.

The Ivory Tower's supply of giant crab blood has run out, and they've stopped receiving their usual shipments from the Grippli village to the south, along with Adran's favorite crab meat dish. If the party can travel south and find out why the Grippli have stopped sending crab blood and meat to The Heavenly Cay, he'll be happy to help them. He'll have heard of a band of Yuan-Ti that sailed that way some weeks ago, around the time that the supplies stopped.

And thus starts the **Book of Cylinders**

## Blood Extraction Process
A special procedure for extracting specific "essences" from a body. Simply trying to draw out the blood or arcane energies will result in simple blood/energy being extracted.

1. Inject treated giant crab blood which will bind to the target "essence" and make it susceptible to freezing
2. Once located, freeze the blood with a specialized arcane laser
3. Draw out the essence with a syringe for bodily fluids, or a crystal siphon for arcane or spiritual energies

## Viserion and King Samuel
Viserion has brought King Samuel here because he needs the special equipment in the Ivory Tower biological research division in order to extract Samuel's "Blood of the Giants". Because the Blood of the Giants is an integral part of who King Samuel is, the process will render him completely catatonic forever.

So, Viserion is masquerading as a medical student at the Ivory Tower and assistant to Adran Galanodel, working on a plan to gain access to the advanced medical equipment necessary to perform the procedure. The king is under the effect of a True Polymorph spell, and is now in the form of a lizard. Viserion stole a spell scroll from a traveling wizard. Viserion has assumed the guise of a clumsy halfling named Rion Blackspice, with his pet lizard Fangs. Viserion is also attempting to research the location of the Giant Finger Bones said to be somewhere in the archipelago. The party may meet him while they're in the city.

Depending on where the players look, they may discover that Rion is in possession of Liara's clan's advanced spellbook. The book contains a selection of 9th level spells, including True Resurrection, which Viserion needs in order to bring Anguisa back to life, and the True Polymorph spell that transformed King Samuel into the lizard, Fangs.
