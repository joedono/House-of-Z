# Second Examination
With the crab's blood now in hand, Adran and Rion have everything they need to attempt to extract Anguisa's essence from Valmar and Liara.

## Blood Extraction Procedure
A special procedure for extracting specific "essences" from a body. Simply trying to draw out the blood or arcane energies will result in simple blood/energy being extracted.

1. Use scanning equipment to get an imprint of the target "essence"
2. Use the imprint to treat the giant crab blood so that it will bind to the target "essence" and make it susceptible to freezing
3. Inject the patient with the treated giant crab blood
4. Scan the patient for the binding agent
5. Once located, freeze the "essence" with a specialized arcane laser
6. Draw out the essence with a syringe for bodily fluids, or a crystal siphon for arcane or spiritual energies, into a suitable vessel

## Viserion and King Samuel
Viserion has brought King Samuel here because he needs to learn the "essence extraction" procedure from Adran Galonodel in order to extract Samuel's "Blood of the Giants". Because the Blood of the Giants is an integral part of who King Samuel is, the process will render him completely catatonic forever.

So, Viserion has assumed the guise of a clumsy halfing named Rion Blackspice, and has entrenched himself as Adran's newest apprentice. Rion is secretly working on a plan to gain access to the advanced medical equipment necessary to perform the extraction procedure on King Samuel, who is under the effect of a True Polymorph spell, and is now in the form of Rion's lizard familiar, Fangs. Viserion is also monitoring the efforts of some Yuan-Ti minions leftover from Loftran to excavate the Giant Finger Bones located beneath the Grippli temple to the south. Rion is also in possession of Liara's clan's advanced spellbook. The book contains a selection of 9th level spells, including True Resurrection, which Viserion needs in order to bring Anguisa back to life, and the True Polymorph spell that transformed King Samuel into the lizard, Fangs.

Now that Rion has located Anguisa, he will steal the vessel containing her soul at the first opportunity, killing Adran if he has to.
