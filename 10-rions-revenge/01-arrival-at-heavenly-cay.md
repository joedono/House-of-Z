# Heavenly Cay
The party arrives at The Heavenly Cay after a grueling trek across the Seacracker Isles. Krusk and Brocc park the ship at the south-western port, the main port for all trade vessels. They'll be in port for a while, unloading their shipment of trade goods and waiting for their next client, a shipment of high quality textiles bound for Linen Street back in Loftran. They'll happily offer the party a return trip for 20gp/person again, but they're not leaving for another month. Brocc will suggest that the party enjoy the festival.

The day when the party arrives is the third day of a 5-day long summer solstice festival called Stoneheart. There are 3 other such holidays that celebrate the fall equinox, winter solstice, and spring equinox, called Festival of Ravens, Oxstone, and The Festival of Flowers respectively.

Stoneheart is characterized by parades, food stands, and the exchange of gifts, traditionally those created within the past year. It is a festival of growth and taking advantage of the fruits of our labor. The city will be very noisy and friendly during this time.

## The Parade
The person the party is looking for is the head of humanoid biology and research at The Ivory Tower, Professor Adran Galanodel.

When the party arrives, Adran is in an ox-drawn carriage with a humanoid skeleton puppet that is fully articulate mounted on top walking in the parade. Soon after the party finds him, the float behind Adran's explodes prematurely, spooking the ox and setting the carriage on fire, and causing them to run rampant through the streets. A chase ensues.

### The Chase
Skill Challenge
DC = 16
Challenges = 7
Goal: Stop the runaway ox-drawn carriage with minimal collateral damage and with minimal damage to Adran's person

1. The carriage dashes past an aquatic float, with an aquarium. Maybe there's a way to use the water to put out the fire.
2. A party member could get onto the carriage and try to calm the oxen
3. The carriage dashes past a botanical float, full of cabbages. Maybe there's a way to destroy it, spilling the cabbages into the street in front of the oxen, calming them
4. The carriage is speeding towards a group of children. Move the children or redirect the oxen
5. Rion Blackspice attempts to cast a spell to solve the situation, but the party recognizes the sigils for the Fly spell. Stop the him before he makes things worse.
6. The carriage makes a sharp turn down a street that is under construction. There are mounds of dirt everywhere. Maybe the dirt could be used to slow the oxen or put out the fire. Or maybe the oxen will cause greater havoc and damage to the carriage
7. A dog is running alongside the carriage, barking and further spooking the oxen. Get her out of there before she gets trampled.
