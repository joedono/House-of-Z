**Note:** Theryn is the only party member who speaks Primordial.

Have the evil Yuan-Ti band be made up of cultists leftover from the Ritual of Zehir in Loftran, including Caleb. They're still devoted to Zehir, and believe that they have been receiving visions and messages from him, instructing them to go to the grippli temple and find what is buried underneath. In reality, all their messages and visions (even since before Loftran) have been from Viserion or one of his other minions.

During the final battle with the evil yuan-ti, have one or more of them kneel down and offer prayer to Zehir, pleading with him to come to their aid. Magic will flash around the kneeling yuan-ti, and a successful Arcana check might reveal this as similar to the Sending spell (although inadvertent). Viserion will receive the message and might leave to investigate the grippli village, leading to the party's first encounter with him.

## Finger Bones
The module mentions that there is more to be excavated under the Grippli Temple. Deep underground is where the three Giant Finger Bones are. These bones have the ability to influence the mood of nearby creatures. When the grippli occupied the temple and village, it emitted encouragement and happiness, enticing them to stay where they were and giving them the impression that their temple was sacred and should be protected. The grippli interpreted this energy as that of Eldath (sister of Mielikki, Ardin's patron). So for hundreds of years, the grippli dutifully guarded the temple, oblivious of what truly remained sleeping beneath it.

Several decades ago, *something* happened and the Finger Bones stopped emitting the beckoning energy. The grippli still believed the temple was sacred, but no longer felt the need to guard it so closely. They relocated their village a mile away in order to be on the coast.
