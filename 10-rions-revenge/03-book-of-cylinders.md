**Note:** Theryn is the only party member who speaks Primordial. Ardin can cast Comprehend Languages as a ritual.

Have the evil Yuan-Ti band be made up of cultists leftover from the Ritual of Zehir in Loftran, including Caleb. They're still devoted to Zehir, and believe that they have been receiving visions and messages from him, instructing them to go to the grippli temple and find what is buried underneath (Draffnir's Finger Bones). In reality, all their messages and visions (even since before Loftran) have been from Viserion.

During the final battle with the evil yuan-ti, have one or more of them kneel down and offer prayer to Zehir, pleading with him to come to their aid. Magic will flash around the kneeling yuan-ti, and a successful Arcana check might reveal this as similar to the Sending spell (although inadvertent). Viserion will receive the message and might leave to investigate the grippli village, leading to the party's first encounter with him.

## Brood Pool Fight
If the fight is going poorly for the players (which it probably won't), have one of the brooding pools be filled with a batch of Mimic Ivy instead of Grippli eggs. Splurgl might know, or the mound can consume the Yuan-Ti who goes around poisoning the pools.

## Finger Bones
The module mentions that there is more to be excavated under the Grippli Temple. Deep underground is where the three Giant Finger Bones are. These bones have the ability to influence the mood of nearby creatures. When the grippli occupied the temple and village, it emitted encouragement and happiness, enticing them to stay where they were and giving them the impression that their temple was sacred and should be protected. The grippli interpreted this energy as that of Eldath (sister of Mielikki, Ardin's patron). So for hundreds of years, the grippli dutifully guarded the temple, oblivious of what truly remained sleeping beneath it.

Someone will clue the party in to the fact that there's a legend of a mysterious artifact buried in the southern regions of the islands known as the Middle Point Ring. This is another name for the Giant Finger Bones, and it's buried under the Grippli Temple.

Several decades ago, *something* happened and the Finger Bones stopped emitting the beckoning energy. The grippli still believed the temple was sacred, but no longer felt the need to guard it so closely. They relocated their village a mile away in order to be on the coast. That *something* will be a direct consequence of the ongoing war between dragons and celestials that is consuming the rest of the world.
