# Back to Heaven
With the crab's blood now in hand, Adran and Rion have everything they need to attempt to extract Anguisa's essence from Valmar and Liara. Unfortunately, it's going to take three days to treat the crab's blood, giving the party some time to explore around the city a little more.

Some points of interest that the party can interact with while they wait for the crab's blood to be treated.

## Ralovyre Family
If the party goes to visit any of Ibal's relatives, here's what they might find.

### Parents
Father Folas Ralovyre (517) and Mother Chalia Ralovyre (456). They generally disapprove of Ibal's chosen profession of investigation into humanoid psychology and searching for mysteries to solve, but they see it as a phase that he has to go through before he "falls back in line" and comes home to pursue magic or artificery. They live in the Gilded Circle district and all but two of their house staff are Warforged servants. They're effectively retired and living in comfort.

#### Servants
Most of their servants are effectively nameless. Their head chef is a Warforged named Clink, their head butler is currently a human male named Rionce, and his assistant is a young human female named Trifle. Ibal will remember Clink and Rionce, but Trifle is a new addition that he hasn't met yet.

#### Quest

### Rhys Ralovyre
Older Brother. Sees Ibal's chosen life as impetuous and misguided. He can't understand why their parents are letting Ibal go on like this, but won't criticize them openly.

### Allannia Ralovyre
Older Sister. Dotes on Ibal and loves him. She takes an honest interest in his profession and approves of his choices, despite what the rest of their family think.
