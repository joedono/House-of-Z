# Quick Transport
Viserion flew to Durrstaft, to the east. The party needs to secure transport that way in order to stop him.

## Options
1. Find Ibal's sister, who is the spellcaster of the family, and show her the runes she needs in order to cast Teleportation Circle and get the party to Loftran
2. Locate the crew of the Sea Spear and convince them to return and make the trip back to Loftran two weeks early
3. Charter another boat across the Seacracker Islands

## Allannia Ralovyre
Older Sister. Dotes on Ibal and loves him. She takes an honest interest in his profession and approves of his choices, despite what the rest of their family think. Allannia is a Potions Professor at The Ivory Tower. Alannia is a 10th level wizard who does know the Teleportation Circle spell.

### Current Events
Depending on the time of day, Allannia will be:
1. Having morning breakfast/tea in the cafeteria of the Ivory Tower
2. Teaching her potions class in the laboratory (possible explosions)
3. Out shopping in the Gilded Circle, usually for clockwork alchemical instruments
4. Putting in an order to Tabitha in Loftran (or other) for alchemical ingredients
5. Watching clockwork cart races
6. Somewhere else on the grounds of the Ivory Tower, possibly grading tests
7. Retiring to her dorm suite

If the party asks Allannia to cast Teleportation Circle to send them to Loftran, she'll have forgotten her component pouch at *Springs, Sprockets, and Servants*. She was there consulting with Rhys about building her own clockwork cart for the races.

## Rhys Ralovyre
Older Brother. Sees Ibal's chosen life as impetuous and misguided. He can't understand why their parents are letting Ibal go on like this, but won't criticize them openly. Rhys is currently at his artificer shop, *Springs, Sprockets, and Servants*.

### Current Events
At around the time the party arrives, one of Rhys' artificers is having a grand opening and revealing his latest creation, the Complete HoUse Manager, or CHUM. The thing will, of course, go haywire, and attack the people inside the shop.

## Chartering a Boat

### Sea Spear
The Sea Spear is still docked, but it can be made ready to sail given a high enough Persuasion check. The problem is that none of the crew are around. They're scattered throughout the city.
* Captain Krusk - Fishing off the northern-most pier of Enlightenment
* First Mate Brocc - Enjoying a find day/night at a brothel in Wingtop
* Helmsman Harim - Selling his whittling projects at a booth outside the Manufactory
* Navigator Lily - Attending a clockwork cart race with Candice
* Cook Candice - Attending a clockwork cart race with Lily
* Engineer Folmon - Just finish work as a pyrotechnician for the Stoneheart Festival Fireworks. Currently looking for more engineering work. There is a nobleman in Gilded Circle who requisitioned him for repairs to a windmill.
* Surgeon Respen - Enjoying quiet time reading at The Purple Lotus

### Other Options
There are two other crews that are getting ready to set sail, but both are bound for small villages within the Seacracker Islands. They're smaller boats not designed for the entire journey to the other side of the islands. It will take a hefty persuasion roll or a lot of gold to make the trip all the way to Loftran.

---

One way or another, the party leaves The Heavenly Cay, bound for Loftran, Frostfall Pass, and eventually Durrstaft.
