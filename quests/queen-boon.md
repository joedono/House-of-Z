# Queen's Boon
The party is likely to make good on their desire for a ship. The Queen will offer them a choice between an unfurnished Brigantine that is seaworthy and in good repair, and a [Folding Boat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/folding-boat). She'll take them down to the Giantvein River, which borders Loftran, to present the choice to the party.

If they ask for something else, deal with it accordingly.
