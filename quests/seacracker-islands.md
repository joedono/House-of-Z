# Seacracker Islands
A network of islands arranged in strange patterns with treacherous currents and dangerous obstacles. Sailing through here without a current map or an experienced sailor is a recipe for death. Durrstahft and the Cay both have master sailors for hire and maps for sale depending on what the players want, but navigating through the waters is still perilous. Many dangerous creatures live there.

## Frostcracker Islands
The northern reaches of the islands are even more dangerous than Seacracker, due to the presence of ice flows. One is never actually sure whether the island is actually an island or just a really big ice block. Because there's fewer people up here, there's more monsters.

## Heavenly Cay
Ibal's home, which means his family is in the vicinity.

A very high-brow city of most elves. A lot of value is placed on the study of the world through magic. Travel between the islands is aided by magical bridges that act as moving walkways, similar to a modern airport. But those only extend around the locations immediately adjacent to the city. The city residents all take basic sailing lessons as a matter of course, although it's rare for a citizen to take sailor as an actual profession. They're necessary and not really looked down upon, but it's seen as a bit of a dead-end job since it doesn't offer a path to enlightenment.

### Ivory Tower
The premiere magical academy in this world. The Wizard's College in Loftran is second, but both will tell you they are the best. While the Wizard's College is an advocate for "everyone deserves knowledge", The Ivory Tower is much snobbier about who they teach, requiring that you demonstrate significant potential in magical studies in order to be granted privileges and access and stuff. The Heavenly Cay is a geniocracy, rule by the intelligent. This means that the headmaster of the Ivory Tower and his advisers also serve as the ruling body for the Heavenly Cay as a whole.

The whole neighborhood is going to be very similar to Hogwarts and the various magical areas presented in the books.

### Viserion and King Samuel
Viserion has brought King Samuel here because he needs the special equipment in the Ivory Tower biological research division in order to extract Samuel's "giant's blood". Just extracting his blood will result in just regular blood. The giant's blood will move around the body, avoiding contact with any injuries or other openings. Special equipment needs to be employed to freeze the giant's blood in place, then detect it where it's frozen, and then to draw it out. The process leaves the victim a shell of their former selves.

So, Viserion is masquerading as a medical student at the Ivory Tower, working on a plan to gain access to the advanced medical equipment necessary to perform the procedure. The king is under the effect of a True Polymorph spell, and is now in the form of a lizard. Viserion stole a spell scroll from a traveling wizard. Viserion has assumed the guise of a clumsy halfling named Rion Blackspice, with his pet lizard Fangs. Viserion is also attempting to research the location of the Giant Finger Bones said to be somewhere in the archipelago. The party may meet him while they're in the city.

## Finger Bones
The three Giant Finger Bones are at the bottom of the Grippli Temple south of the Heavenly Cay. These bones have the ability to influence the mood of nearby creatures. When the grippli occupied the temple and village, it emitted encouragement and happiness, enticing them to stay where they were and giving them the impression that their temple was sacred and should be protected. The grippli interpreted this energy as that of Eldath (sister of Mielikki, Ardin's patron). So for hundreds of years, the grippli dutifully guarded the temple, oblivious of what truly remained sleeping beneath it.

Several decades ago, *something* happened and the Finger Bones stopped emitting the beckoning energy. The grippli still believed the temple was sacred, but no longer felt the need to guard it so closely. They relocated their village a mile away in order to be on the coast.

If/when the characters venture to the Ivory Tower (and if they're level 6 or higher), plant a hook to lead them to the Book of Cylinders adventure from Candlekeep Mysteries: https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cm/book-of-cylinders

**Note:** Theryn is the only party member who speaks Primordial.

### Book of Cylinders Alterations
Have the evil Yuan-Ti band be made up of cultists leftover from the Ritual of Zehir in Loftran, including Caleb. They're still devoted to Zehir, and believe that they have been receiving visions and messages from him, instructing them to go to the grippli temple and find what is buried underneath. In reality, all their messages and visions (even since Loftran) have been from Viserion or one of his other minions.

During the final battle with the evil yuan-ti, have one or more of them kneel down and offer prayer to Zehir, pleading with him to come to their aid. Magic will flash around the kneeling yuan-ti, and a successful Arcana check might reveal this as similar to the Sending spell (although inadvertent). Viserion will receive the message and might leave to investigate the grippli village, leading to the party's first encounter with him.
