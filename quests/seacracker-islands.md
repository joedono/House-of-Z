# Seacracker Islands

## Heavenly Cay
Ibal's home, which menas his family is in the vicinity.

A very high-brow city of most elves. A lot of value is placed on the study of the world through magic. Travel between the islands is aided by magical bridges that act as moving walkways, similar to a modern airport. But those only extend around the locations immediately adjacent to the city. The city residents all take basic sailing lessons as a matter of course, although it's rare for a citizen to take sailor as an actual profession. They're necessary and not really looked down upon, but it's seen as a bit of a dead-end job since it doesn't offer a path to enlightenment.

## Ivory Tower
The premiere magical academy in this world. The Wizard's College in Loftran is second, but both will tell you they are the best. While the Wizard's College is an advocate for "everyone deserves knowledge", The Ivory Tower is much snobbier about who they teach, requiring that you demonstrate significant potential in magical studies in order to be granted privileges and access and stuff. The Heavenly Cay is a geniocracy, rule by the intelligent. This means that the headmaster of the Ivory Tower and his advisers also serve as the ruling body for the Heavenly Cay as a whole.

The whole neighborhood is going to be very similar to Hogwarts and the various magical areas presented in the books.

## Seacracker Islands
A network of islands arranged in strange patterns with treacherous currents and dangerous obstacles. Sailing through here without a current map or an experienced sailor is a recipe for death. Durrstahft and the Cay both have master sailors for hire and maps for sale depending on what the players want.

## Frostcracker Islands
The northern reaches of the islands are even more dangerous than Seacracker, due to the presence of ice flows. One is never actually sure whether the island is actually an island or just a really big ice block. Because there's fewer people up here, there's more monsters.

## Viserion and King Samuel
Viserion has brought King Samuel here because he needs the special equipment in the Ivory Tower biological research division in order to extract Samuel's "giant's blood". Just extracting his blood will result in just regular blood. The giant's blood will move around the body, avoiding contact with any injuries or other drains. Special equipment needs to be employed to freeze the blood in place, then detect it where it's frozen, and then finally, draw it out. The process leaves the victim a shell of their former selves.

So, Viserion is masquerading as a medical student at the Ivory Tower, working on a plan to gain access to the advanced medical equipment necessary to perform the procedure. The king is under the effect of a True Polymorph spell, and is now in the form of a lizard. Viserion stole a spell scroll from a traveling wizard. Viserion has assumed the guise of a clumsy halfling named Rion Blackspice, with his pet lizard Fangs. The party may meet while they're in the city.
