# Quest Ideas

## Wizard's Final Exam
Cathlene's final exam is coming up in a few months and she needs help studying. Maybe take her on a quest to get some real world experience. She has a grudge against Fran for "killing" her during their last study session.

## Snow Mutant
Karina's Snow Mutant is still alive. After it recuperates, it'll start terrorizing travelers through Frostfall Pass again.

## Black Dragon Hatchling
Tabitha is now in possession of a whole dragon egg. She's smart enough and self-centered enough to not be affected by it and not to hatch it. Helen.... not so much.

The egg can be hatched by submerging it in boiling acid overnight. Tabitha knows this, although it'll take a very high Persuasion or Intimidation roll to get her to say anything. The party can also find the method in the Wizard's Library (NOT in the forbidden section. There are books on the lifecycle of dragons freely available). It'll hatch into a Black Dragon Hatchling https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Dragon_Hatchling_(5e_Monster) that the players can decide what to do with, but keeping it will agitate Anguisa periodically.

Curiosity will take hold in Helen's mind and be enhanced by the enticing energies given off by the egg. After enough exposure, Helen will research how to hatch the egg, steal it from Tabitha, and bring it somewhere secluded where she can hatch it and care for the dragon herself. The energies it emits are an evolutionary trait that ensure that the mother takes care of the newborn, instead of eating it. Those energies only have minor influence on the mother dragon, but have the ability to brainwash normal humans and take over their senses.

## Eloreth Bank Account
20,000gp in an unclaimed account at the bank in Loftran. Need the Eloreth signet ring.

## Wild Magic Brother
Have the party encounter a sorcerer who attempted to suppress their Wild Magic only to have it go completely crazy.
