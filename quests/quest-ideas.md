# Quest Ideas

## Wizard's Final Exam
Cathlene's final exam is coming up in a few months and she needs help studying. Maybe take her on a quest to get some real world experience. She has a grudge against Fran for "killing" her during their last study session.

## Snow Mutant
Karina's Snow Mutant is still alive. After it recuperates, it'll start terrorizing travelers through Frostfall Pass again.

## Black Dragon Hatchling
Tabitha is now in possession of a whole dragon egg. She's smart enough and self-centered enough to not be affected by it and not to hatch it. Helen.... not so much.

The egg can be hatched by submerging it in boiling acid overnight. Tabitha knows this, although it'll take a very high Persuasion or Intimidation roll to get her to say anything. The party can also find the method in the Wizard's Library (NOT in the forbidden section. There are books on the lifecycle of dragons freely available). It'll hatch into a Black Dragon Hatchling https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Dragon_Hatchling_(5e_Monster) that the players can decide what to do with, but keeping it will agitate Anguisa periodically.

Curiosity will take hold in her mind and be enhanced by the enticing energies given off by the egg. After enough exposure, Helen will research how to hatch the egg, steal it from Tabitha, and bring it somewhere secluded where she can hatch it and care for the dragon herself. The energies it emits are an evolutionary trait that ensure that the mother takes care of the newborn, instead of eating it. Those energies only have minor influence on the mother dragon, but have the ability to brainwash normal humans and take over their senses.

Several Yuan-Ti rolled into a village and massacred the population. They were repelled by the local militia, but one retreated into the local church, where it converted all the church-goers into Yuan-Ti, or attempted to. The clerics came outside some time later, holding blackened pieces of scaled flesh. They looked sad and....broken. The next day, the clerics didn't allow anyone into the church the next day. Every few days ever since, broken strangers would arrive at the town, one or two at a time. They'd head for the church and be allowed inside. The mayor has no idea what's going on inside that church, and wants to hire adventurers to investigate. The clerics are armed and have enough numbers to match the town militia, so they need help.

The clerics have begun wearing strange arm-bands to signify their order. A Religion check will reveal it to be completely non-religious, not belonging to any particular order. A Medicine check will reveal it to be an ancient alchemical symbol for poison. The clerics didn't know, but don't seem to mind upon finding out.

Optional: There's a noble scholar who has also been trying to gain entrance into the church, but with the offer to repair and translate some of the ancient texts in the church's library that deal with its founding, as well as the mysterious new god the clerics are worshiping (Zehir/Viserion). He will succeed the day before the party attempts to gain entrance into the church.

The inside is full of sacrilegious images and stinks of decay and death. A group of clerics stand guard outside the church and don't take kindly to visitors of any sort. They're armed with knives and dark magic.

## Wild Magic Brother
Have the party encounter a sorcerer who attempted to suppress their Wild Magic only to have it go completely crazy.
