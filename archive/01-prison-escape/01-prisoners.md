# Prisoners
All of you have been arrested for one crime or another (for those of you who are Lawful Good or something, you might have been framed). You're minding your own business, waiting for your trials, when you notice that you haven't seen the guards all day. Come to think of it, you haven't heard any human activity from your windows since the day before yesterday. Something is amiss outside. It is way too quiet.

Players start in Hanging Noose Prison, probably with one or two of them being thrown in fresh that day. Give them a couple days of in-game time to talk amongst themselves, amuse themselves with whatever they have access to in prison, which probably isn't much. All their belongings have been confiscated. Any spellcasters have had their hands tied and their mouths gagged to prevent spellcasting, or maybe they have special manacles that prevent casting, but still allow roleplaying.

Players encounter a handful of roleplaying situations, perhaps they get visitors from their past or people who have to do with their incarceration. There's next to no privacy, so this would be a good way to reveal backstory elements and include them in the narrative a little.

After a couple days, the players notice that they haven't gotten any visitors since yesterday and haven't seen the guards all day. Perhaps that night, a guard stumbles in bloody and broken. He falls to the ground and his keyring slides across the floor to within reach of one of the players, who is now able to let themselves and the other players out.

The players leave their cells, locate and gather their things, and escape into a town that is almost completely devoid of life. They now have to escape whatever is still around hunting people, and deal with whatever comes next.

## NPCs

### Malcom
Male Human Prison Guard. Does the rounds on the players' cells. Is sympathetic for their plights, but won't listen to anything they have to say. Has a wife and daughter at home that he's always talking about.

### Gorma
Female Half-Orc Prison Guard. Does rounds and brings the players their food rations. Not friendly at all, but not sadistic. Views prisoners as maggots deserving of the worst punishments. They're blights on society and are getting exactly what they deserve. Any of the players who believe they were framed are lying.

### Caleb
Male Human Prison Guard. As sadistic as they come. Enjoys torturing the prisoners, but his fear of Gorma keeps him in line...usually. Might be caught trying to poison one of the players' rations, or jab them with a stick.

### Eldon
Male Halfling Prisoner. Was thrown in jail the same day as Ibal (5 days ago) for stealing from a noble who was out to market. The crime absolutely doesn't fit the punishment, which Eldon won't shut up about. But the high profile of the victim means that Eldon will probably get quite the disproportionate punishment. When he's not talking about his crime, Eldon is quite friendly and talkative. He eagerly asks the other prisoners their life stories and borders on being annoying.

## Events

### New Arrival
Valmar/Liara and Ardin are thrown into a cell, after being freshly arrested. They're locked in here together, might as well get to know their cell mates.

### Nightly Rations
Start Guards - Gorma + Malcom
Gorma and Malcom bring each player their rations. The guards work three cycles of overlapping shifts. 16 hours on, 8 hours off, always two guards on duty at a time. This is the end of Malcom's shift. Caleb will come in shortly to take over for the overnight. Gorma and Malcom make their deliveries, then Gorma leaves. Malcom expresses his sympathy to the prisoners. At least one of them is coming up on trial and probably sentencing, and Malcom wishes there was something he could do. Roleplay opportunity here to attempt to extract more information out of Malcom. He has a sick wife at home and an infant son. She might not last much longer without medicine. The expensive kind that a guard's salary can't afford. Malcom might become friendly to the players, but will refuse to help them do anything tonight.

Night Shift - Gorma + Caleb

### Rude Awakening
Caleb and Gorma have run the night shift. On the shift change, in between Gorma leaving and Malcom arriving, Caleb takes the alone time as an opportunity to harass the prisoners. He wakes them up by banging loudly on the bars and then delivers their breakfast. He's poisoned at least one players breakfast. Nothing lethal, but enough to make them miserable all day. A DC 15 CON save is enough to shrug off the effects. Failure means the day is spent vomiting, much to Caleb's enjoyment. If tensions run high, Malcom will arrive just in time to get Caleb away from the prisoners.

Morning Shift - Caleb + Malcom

### Rumors
With a DC 12 Perception check, the players can overhear Malcom and Caleb later discussing some mysterious murders the night before. They reiterate that it seems to be safest to stay indoors at night. If the players engage them in conversation, a DC 15 Persuasion check (10 if the players befriended Malcom the previous day) will yield more information out of Malcom. People are being found with gash or claw marks on their body in the mornings. Whatever it is seems too brutal and jagged to be from a knife or sword. Rumors are that there is a beast that is prowling the city at night, but despite doubling and tripling the guards, no one has seen or caught anything.

Afternoon Shift - Malcom + Gorma

### Visitors
One or more of the players receive visitors. Possibilities: Eldon's brother, who was there with him during the thieving fiasco (Eldon might blame him for his imprisonment, but it comes with the career), one or more of the people who were at the tavern during the fight that got Theryn and Fran arrested, the family of the victim in the murder case that Ibal was trying to solve, and one of Caleb's equally sadistic guard friends.

### Second Night
Night Shift - Caleb + Gorma

Malcom leaves for his sleep shift, Caleb arrives and he and Gorma to watch the players through the night. During the night, the players will be woken up by a green flash in the distance, followed about an hour later by growls, screams, and sounds of violence in the distance.

### Sadistic Tendencies
Morning Shift - Caleb + Malcom

The next morning, Gorma leaves for her sleep shift, and Malcom arrives. Caleb spends most of the day heckling the prisoners, jeering at them, throwing dirt at them, and poking them with sticks.

Afternoon Shift - Gorma + Malcom

Gorma arrives for her shift and immediately goes to action. She sees the prisoners as maggots, but even maggots deserve to be left alone to rot. They come to blows, and it ends with Gorma sending Caleb home bleeding for the day. She finishes her shift by herself, awaiting Malcom's arrival in the afternoon.

### Last Night - Prison Break
Night Shift - Gorma + Caleb?

It's the end of Gorma's shift and Caleb is no where to be found. Gorma leaves Malcom alone with the prisoners for the night to go search for him. Some time after she leaves, the players see another pillar of green light, this time much closer. A few minutes later, Gorma returns. She screams for Malcom to come outside. Malcom leaves. The players hear more screams and brutality from outside. Malcom returns a little later, with blood pouring out of his stomach. He collapses in front of one of the player's cells, and the key ring to their cells clatters to within reach of the player.
