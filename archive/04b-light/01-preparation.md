# Preparation
The players have decided to go to the mines north of Loftran. Their quest is to obtain a large raw Hatching Stone for use in the cleansing ritual that will destroy the power source for the evil ritual the Cult of Zehir is attempting.

## Introduction
In order to find a Hatching Stone of appropriate size, the players must journey deep into the mines, as all the large ones close to the surface have been mined and processed already, rendering them useless for the purpose the players need them for. They must journey into the Deep Floor to find the raw stones. That deep into the mines, the aether that forms the stones saturates the air like radiation, being dangerous to living creatures. The players must don special filtration suits in order to journey that far without adverse side effects.

Several months ago, a mechanical malfunction caused the safety mechanisms on the lift to give way, sending it crashing to the bottom of the Deep Floor, with a dozen or so miners still in it. A rescue party was assembled to rappel down to find them, but they found only corpses. Unbeknownst to the players and the other miners, at least one of those poor souls survived down there. After months of being assaulted by the raw aether down there, the person mutated, like the rest of the life that manages to survive on the Deep Floor, mutating them into a crystalline abomination that roams the Deep Floor.


## NPCs

### Foreman Clast
Half-orc miner and de factor leader of the mining coalition assigned to the mines. He'll be the primary source of information for the players. Believes in an honest days work. Developed a drinking problem after the accident. Blames himself for the technical failure two months ago that stranded a group of miners and their guard detail on the Deep Floor, despite there being nothing he could have done about it.

### Quartermaster Heath Levenworth
Human quartermaster for the miners. Works in the storeroom and handles requests for equipment. The players will meet him when they go to procure aether filtration suits. A kind old soul. Been working in the mines for 40 years. Wishes he could still get in there an do some actual mining.

### Engineers Avery and Abel Halverstone
Twin dwarf engineers. They're fresh hires, although they know the engineers who were on duty when the accident happened. They're extremely focused on their work and don't talk to people more than they have to. They know how to fix the lift, but Clast forbade it for fear of others being tempted to go down to the Deep Floor.

### Ex-Engineer Wind O'Leaf
Half-elf engineer. Not actually at the mines. Was the engineer on duty at the time of the accident. His blunder lead to the timing belt tearing and the lift crashing down onto the Deep Floor, stranding several miners (including his wife) on the Deep Floor with a hoard of monsters bearing down on them. Wind has been an emotional wreck ever since and has very nearly spent all of his money on whores to silence the screams he hears in his dreams. The players will not meet him at the mines, but may run into him somewhere in the city.


## Events

### Introductions
Foreman Clast will be summoned once the miners notice the players. He'll inquire about what they're doing there. When the players say they'll need a large hatching stone, Clast will apologize and say that another one won't form for another couple weeks. When the players express urgency, Clast will say that there might be large stones in the Deep Floor of the mine, but that people are forbidden from going down there. It's too dangerous, due to the condensed aether permeating the floor. If the party insists, then Clast will say that the lift is broken and that he has forbidden his engineers from fixing it. After that, the party can do what they like, but the miners will all be keeping an eye on them to make sure they don't steal anything.

### Repairing the Lift
The party has a couple options for fixing the lift. When they inquire about engineers, they'll learn about Avery, Abel, and Wind.

Abel and Avery respect Clast's word more than the king's law and that convincing them to fix the lift might be hard. The party can earn their cooperation by promising to bring them Abel's stone-finder, a gadget for locating hatching stones that he lost down the mineshaft into the Deep Floor. The party just has to make sure they're not disturbed while they work.

The miners will tell Wind's story, about how he was the engineer who repaired the lift just before it's disastrous malfunction, stranding the lost miners on the Deep Floor as they were being attacked. He's probably drowning his sorrows at Bannow's Place, a nearby pub and favorite of most miners. If the players go there, they can find Wind drunk, no matter why time of day it is. He can be convinced to fix the lift if the players promise revenge on the monsters on the Deep Floor, along with retrieving Wind's wife's bracelet that he gave her.

### Rope
As an alternative to repairing the lift, the players might elect to buy enough rope to rappel down the shaft into the Deep Floor. This is ill-advised, as they'll have a really hard time getting the large hatching stone back up again.

### Obtaining Filtration Suits
As the players explore the mines, they'll notice several miners wearing full-body protective suits. These are filtration suits designed to protect against the aether concentration in the mines. The party will need some if they're going to go to the deep floor. They'll be directed to Quartermaster Levenworth.

Heath Levenworth is a kindly old man who will be reluctant to give the players filtration suits due to their youth, the fact that they aren't miners, and the dangers posed by the Deep Floor (if they mention that). He might reminisce about his days as a miner and about how he spent a lot of time in the Deep Floor. He wishes he could have just one souvenir from down there, giving the players an opening to persuade him to give them filtration suits. As a final warning, Heath will lift up his shirt, revealing slight crystal scaling caused by aether poisoning.

### Descent
Once the party has obtained the services of one of the engineers and aether filtration suits for everyone, they're ready to descend the lift
