# Assembly
It will take a few days for the clerics to charge the Large Hatching Stone with enough energy to destroy the power source and to brew the mystic antidote and allow it to ferment and become usable, leaving the party with some downtime. They'll be asked to come back on the evening of the day after tomorrow.

Players should be level 3 by this point.
