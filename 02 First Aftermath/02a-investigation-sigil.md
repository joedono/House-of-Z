# Sigil
The players have opted to attempt to locate the sigil that activated last night and see what information they can gleam from it. With a bit of persuasion, they can get the information out of Aiden Collander, who witnessed the sigil's activation the night before. A DC 15 Persuasion check could convince Aiden to show them exactly where the sigil was, or an Investigation check will eventually take the players to where the sigil was blasted.


## NPCs

### Aiden Collander
Human Merchant. Prominent (and loud) merchant of fresh fruits and fine wines.


## Events

### State of Affairs
If Aiden was convinced to accompany the players, he'll first lead them to his shop, which has unfortunately been completely ransacked. Aiden's assistant's body can be seen in a pool of blood on the ground inside the shop. Weirdly enough, although a good number of the wine bottles are broken or scattered, it doesn't look like any are actually missing. While there, an elderly gnome will approach and inquire calmly whether Aiden is open for business. If asked, the gnome won't know anything about whatever happened the night before. He'll claim that he turned out his light and slept soundly the entire night. He'll idly wonder where his daughter got off to though. She was killed in the attack.

### Arrival at the Sigil
The players eventually find the spot where the green light came from. It's a nondescript location in the middle of the street, not too far from Aiden's fruit and wine shop. The sigil looks like a series of curved lines resembling a circle with entwined snakes inside it scorched into the ground. A DC 15 Religion check reveals that it vaguely resembles the mark of Zehir, the god of poisons and darkness. A DC 15 Arcana check reveals that the sigil is mostly dormant. It is emitting a low, subtle form of magic. It can be fully activated with the appropriate trigger (darkness). It resembles a car that is stopped at a red light, humming softly, but ready to go as soon as the light turns green.

### Interviewing Witnesses
There are a number of people walking around the area. If the players try to interview them, all will deny that anything happened last night. Some will accuse the players of vandalizing the street, which will attract the attention of the guards. If the situation escalates, the party might get roughed up a bit, but not arrested.

### Side Effects
All the players suffer the aftereffects of being near the sigil, and must make a DC 10 Intelligence Saving Throw. Failure causes the player to become convinced that last night was a fluke and that they're sure everything will be fine from now on. Moving away from the sigil will remove this effect. Now that the players know what it is, it becomes apparent to them that the people around the sigil are similarly effected.

### Being Watched
A DC 20 Perception check will reveal to the players that they are being watched while they are investigating the sigil. They will see a shadow, like a strip of cloth, vanish around a corner. If they give chase, start a skill challenge.

### Catching the Watcher
After successfully chasing and catching the shadowy figure, the party finds that it's a human kid. His name is Marsh Hansen. See his sidequest folder for more information.
