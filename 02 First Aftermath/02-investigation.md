# Investigation
The party has chosen to investigate the Wizard's College

The general vibe in the city close to the churches is one of terror and confusion. No one is sure if last night's attack was a unique incident or the first in a long line of attacks. In reality, it's more like the 3rd or 4th such attack on the city. Other regions have been hit due to them having activated sigils, but word has not spread of the attacks for some reason. As you get closer to an active sigil, however, the mood lightens. People become convinced that nothing is wrong despite obvious signs of death and violence and the presence of rather large circular scorch marks in the ground (the sigils).
