# King Werewolf
Through the adventure, King Samuel of Loftran contracted Lycanthropy. The royal line of Loftran claims to have the Blood of Draffnir or Giants' Blood running through it. That turns out to be true, as evidenced by Samuel's daughter, Princess Selise, who is only 5 or 6, but looks ten years older. Between the giants blood and the werewolf curse, Samuel transformed into a 4-story-tall werewolf in the middle of the night. He wrecked the palace and a good portion of the Heartswall district before disappearing.

It's up to the party to find the King (again) and find a way to remove or control his werewolf curse.
