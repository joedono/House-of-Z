### River of Spirits
The party encounters a 30ft wide river of spirits flowing **up** the mountain. The river is not flowing in a trench. It's more like a moving crowd that takes up space between 0ft and 15ft high.

### Child Spirits
A group of ghost children decide to start playing tricks on the party by
* Impersonating people in trouble
* Attempting to pickpocket them
* Jumpscaring them
* Throwing rocks at them

The children don't mean any real harm, and will express sorrow and apologize as soon as the party shows any aggression or pain.

### Lovers
The ghost of a man is frantically looking for his wife. He'll beg the party for help. He'll mention that they have matching red lockets around their necks. She could be anywhere on this mountain. Nell will ask to see the locket, and by touching it, she'll become attuned to it and be able to sense its mate nearby. The wife will be wandering in a daze up the mountain, mesmerized by the energy at the peak. Nell and the party will have to figure out how to get her attention.

### Ghost Giants
A pair of cloud giant ghosts are sitting on the rocks, watching the sun go down, and musing about the state of things.
