# Dead Marshes
East of Mount Stratha is a large swamp with varying levels of water. There is at least one Grippli village hidden deep in the swamp. Far to the East, but not quite to the coastline, is the lair of Vezdrikex, the Death Tyrant who stole the Spine's necrotic crystal. He's using it to raise an army of undead out of the creatures that live in the swamp. He's had the crystal in his possession for one week by the time the party fights the ghosts in Hazelton.

## Hazards in the Marsh
The marshes are effectively dividied into two areas. The area west of the Grippli village function as a normal swamp with all the normal hazards. Crocodiles, sinkholes, tangling vines, swarms of insects, and other sorts of natural creatures. The region east of the village is under the effects of a Death Tyrant's region as well as the power of the necrotic crystal.

The power of Vezdrikex and the necrotic crystal have caused a sort of undeath plague to eminate out from the eastern edge of the swamp. Every creature that dies in the swamp further east than the Grippli Village is immediately raised as a zombie loyal to Vezdrikex. The plague also gradually rots the flesh of anything living, which is affecting the Grippli. The plague will also effect the players unless they are protected. If asked, Liara will offer them divine charms of protection that accomplish this.
