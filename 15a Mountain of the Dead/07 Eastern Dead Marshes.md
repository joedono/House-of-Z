# Eastern Dead Marshes
In addition to the "normal" environmental hazards of the marshes, this area is teaming with the reanimated zombies and skeletons of various creatures that died in the swamp and were reanimated by the power of the necrotic crystal.

The party is tracking Patricia and her four newly enthralled grippli "tribute". They can move rather quickly through the swamp, as Patricia has the Mobile feat and the grippli are native swimmers and leapers. They are likely to outpace the party easily and make it back to Vezdrikex's lair well before the party.

## Death Tyrant Regional Effects
* Creatures within 1 mile of the tyrant’s lair sometimes feel as if they’re being watched even when they aren’t.
* When a creature hostile to the tyrant and aware of its existence finishes a long rest within 1 mile of the tyrant’s lair, roll a d20 for that creature. On a roll of 10 or lower, the creature is subjected to one random eye ray of the tyrant.
  1. **Charm Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the tyrant for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.
  2. **Paralyzing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  3. **Fear Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  4. **Slowing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can’t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  5. **Enervation Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  6. **Telekinetic Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the tyrant moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. The target is restrained by the ray’s telekinetic grip until the start of the tyrant’s next turn or until the tyrant is incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn’t being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.
  7. **Sleep Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.
  8. **Petrification Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
  9. **Disintegration Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.

### Noogle, The Rogue Grippli
The party runs into a patrol of zombie grippli that set on them at first sight. The last one to be defeated cries out for mercy just before the final blow is struck. This is Noogle. He was visiting the tributes several days ago when Patricia arrived to collect. He knew that she was far more likely to kill him and turn him into a real zombie than to spare him, so he acted the part of a feral zombie who had managed to find his way out of the pen. He acted enthralled by the purple crystal and followed Patricia to meet her boss.

Noogle has not seen Vezdrikex in the non-flesh, only seen his shadow. He knows where the entrance to the lair is, but refuses to go near it. Now that he's free and clear of his fellow zombies, he plans to make a bee-line for the village. He hopes that his sister is still alive there.
