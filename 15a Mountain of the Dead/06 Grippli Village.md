# Grippli Village
Near the halfway point of the Dead Marshes lies a Grippli Village. They live off the land and ride giant bullfrogs as mounts. They have been ravaged by the undeath plague eminating from the necrotic crystal.

## General Description
The village itself is a picture of desperation and despair. It might have seemed nice once, similar to the village in the Seacracker Isles... for frogs. The dwellings are showing mild signs of neglect and disrepair, but the real sign of the despair are the grippli. Every one of them appears to have gaping wounds that don't bleed. Infected or missing eyes, missing flesh on the torso that exposes ribcage, missing limbs, everyone has a chunk of flesh missing from one part or another. Most of the grippli the party will encounter within the village are lucid.

## NPCs

### Bop
Grippli guard. More hopeful that the party has come to help the village.

### Snorkel
Grippli guard. Openly suspicious and won't trust much of what the party says.

### Marsh Father
Patriarch of the grippli village. Doing his best to manage a hopeless situation, but cautious of help. Seems an eagerness to accept help was what got his village into this predicament in the first place. Speaks Grippli, Primordial, and a little Common.

### Patricia Clorus
Female human zombie. Vezdrikex's most trusted general. She's come to collect the "tribute" from the Marsh Father.

## Events

### Approach
The players will start to hear more frog noises mixed in with the natural ambiance of the marshes. The player characters who speak Grippli will recognize words in those noises, saying things like "newcomers", "friend or foe?", "let's wait and see", "watch them". No grippli will appear openly. A DC 20 Perception check will reveal eyes watching from the brush that disappear as soon as they are noticed.

As the party gets close to the village, if they have the protective amulets from Liara, the amulets will start to glow. They are activating and protecting the party from the effects of the necrotic crystal. The Grippli following the party will take notice of this.

### Ambush
As the party approaches the village, two Grippli guards with spears will step out into their path and demand to know their purpose. These are Bop and Snorkel. If the party doesn't respond with hostility, the two guards will take the party to meet the Marsh Father.

### Meeting the Marsh Father
The Marsh Father is the Patriarch of the village and lives in the biggest house on the eastern side of the village. He speaks Grippli, Primordial, and a little Common. He will ask the party about their purpose and ask that they show proof of their intentions.

Regardless of their response, their meeting will be interrupted by Patricia Clorus and a trio of undead crocodiles. She has come to collect the Marsh Father's tribute, meaning any of his number that have turned full zombie. They'll speak Primordial, which means none of the party will understand them. MF will direct Patricia to the "usual gathering spot", a disused giant bullfrog pen on the northern side of the village. Patricia will leave, apparently ignoring the party.

### The Tribute
If the party follows Patricia, they'll see the pen with 4 non-lucid grippli zombies penned in. She'll hold up a small purple crystal and the grippli zombies will be entranced by it and follow Patricia. She will be dissatisfied by the tribute and go into the village. She'll set her crocodiles out to locate more tributes. They'll each break into a home and drag out one grippli. Two of them found non-lucids that the villagers were keeping secret, but one of them drags out a lucid grippli woman. She's begging to be let go. She has a daughter. Patricia won't care and will slit the grippli's throat. She'll rise a moment later as a zombie. Patricia will repeat the process with the shard and leave the village.

If the party attacks Patricia at any point, she'll use the crystal shard to summon two Shambling Mounds and leave them and her three crocodiles to stall the party while she escapes into the marshes.

### Thieves in the Night
If the party decides to take a long rest in the village, the grippli will attempt to steal the characters' amulets of protection. Their guards can become invisible when hiding in shadow.

If successful, the grippli will hide the amulets and feign ignorance, seeing it as just another weird circumstance in a village falling under a curse.

If they fail, the grippli will beg the party for forgiveness and offer to guide them through the rest of the swamp. The grippli don't know where Vezdrikex's lair is, but they will know how to avoid further combat and hazards farther east of the village (for the most part).
